# Green Flags - Staff Engineer Evaluation

## ALWAYS GREEN FLAGS

### Environment & Sustainability
- Profitable or clear path to profitability within 12 months
- ≥18 month funding runway for current team goals
- Engineering budget protected during belt-tightening
- Problems requiring sustained multi-quarter effort to solve
- Team roadmap extending beyond current quarter
- Engineering leadership with IC background
- Structured decision-making frameworks mentioned
- Staff+ engineers with >2 year tenure

### Organizational Maturity
- Sustainable funding model with ≥18 month runway to meaningful goals
- Documented processes without bureaucratic overhead
- Team protected from quarterly resource thrashing
- Problem scope worthy of multi-quarter engineering investment

### Technical Culture
- AI/LLM coding tools explicitly mentioned as approved/encouraged
- Engineering blog with technical depth (not just product announcements)
- Same-day or next-day deployment cycles demonstrated
- Version control, code review, CI/CD treated as basic hygiene

### Work Environment
- Fully remote or remote-first culture established
- Engineering presence in Dublin/London/US East Coast
- Meeting-light culture with protected maker time
- Async-first communication norms

### Recognition & Impact
- Staff engineers participate in technical strategy
- Recent examples of engineering influence on product direction
- Clear performance metrics and promotion criteria
- Success celebrations that include technical achievements

### Engineering Maturity Signals
- Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) publicly maintained
- Postmortem culture without blame
- Technical debt explicitly tracked and prioritized
- Staff engineers have influence on technical direction
- On-call rotation is humane (<1 week/month)

### Decision-Making Culture
- Clear escalation paths and decision makers
- Engineering estimates respected in planning
- Technical input sought for product decisions
- Disagreements resolved with data and principles

### Timezone & Location (OPTIMAL)
- Dublin/London HQ with US East Coast satellite
- Async-first with 4-hour overlap minimum
- Engineering leadership distributed across timezones
- No mandatory West Coast hours
