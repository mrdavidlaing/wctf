# Red Flags - Staff Engineer Evaluation

## ALWAYS RED FLAGS

### Organizational Dysfunction
- Layoffs >5% in past 18 months (especially multiple rounds)
- Executive musical chairs (3+ senior departures in 12 months)
- Engineering leadership without technical background
- "We're in transition" or "figuring out our process"
- Team formations/dissolutions every 6 months
- Projects killed mid-stream due to funding pressure
- Quarterly pivots that restart engineering work

### Technical Red Flags
- AI tools banned, restricted, or "under review"
- Manual deployment processes or >week deploy cycles
- No code review or testing standards
- Legacy tech stack with no modernization plan

### Work Reality Problems
- >50% time in meetings (confirmed with actual schedules)
- Manager with >8 direct reports
- Primary engineering in US West Coast only (timezone mismatch)
- Mandatory office attendance >2 days/week

### Strategic Instability
- Multiple pivots in past 18 months
- Strategy changes faster than execution cycles
- Engineering excluded from product/business decisions
- "Move fast and break things" mentality (burned out on this)

### Market Position Concerns
- Declining revenue or flat growth with high burn
- No clear competitive differentiation
- Customer concentration >40% from single client
- Competing purely on price in commoditized market
- Customer LTV doesn't significantly exceed CAC

### Engineering Immaturity
- No documentation culture
- Hero culture around firefighting
- Technical debt ignored until crisis
- Senior engineers used primarily for implementation
- Always-on incident response expectations

### Decision-Making Dysfunction
- Everything escalates to founders/executives
- Engineering treated as "the factory"
- Product/sales commitments made without engineering input
- Decisions reversed frequently without explanation
