            <h2 style="margin-top: 0; background: none; padding: 0; border: none;">The WCTF Framework</h2>
            <p><strong>Worth Climbing Together Framework (WCTF)</strong> treats job evaluation like planning a mountain expedition. Every job opportunity is a mountain to climb, and success requires more than just a viable business - you need the right peak, the right team, sustainable conditions, and a story worth telling.</p>

            <p><strong>The Mountain Metaphor - Five Dimensions:</strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Mountain Range</strong> - Can <em>any</em> team succeed here? (Business viability, market position, financial health)</li>
                <li><strong>Chosen Peak</strong> - Is everyone climbing the <em>same</em> mountain? (Technical strategy, engineering culture, alignment, <strong>coordination style matches terrain demands</strong> ‚Üê NEW v3.1)</li>
                <li><strong>Rope Team Confidence</strong> - Does the team believe they can succeed <em>together</em>? (Leadership trust, team quality, organizational stability)</li>
                <li><strong>Daily Climb</strong> - Will the 99 days be energizing or draining? (Work-life balance, compensation, daily sustainability)</li>
                <li><strong>Story Worth Telling</strong> - Would you be proud to explain this work? (Career narrative, impact, skills growth)</li>
            </ol>

            <p><strong>Two-Layer Investigation:</strong></p>
            <ul style="margin-top: 0.3cm;">
                <li><strong>Layer 1 (Public Research):</strong> Automated research on financials, market position, organizational news, technical culture - creates baseline understanding and surfaces obvious red flags.</li>
                <li><strong>Layer 2 (Insider Conversations):</strong> Conversations with current/former employees to validate Layer 1 findings, understand ground truth vs PR, and surface cultural nuances.</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Flag-Based Philosophy:</strong> WCTF does not produce numerical scores or automated recommendations. Instead, it surfaces <strong>green flags</strong> (positive signals) and <strong>red flags</strong> (concerns) to inform your gut decision. Context matters - the same fact can be different colors depending on your priorities. There are no perfect companies, only trade-offs.</p>
