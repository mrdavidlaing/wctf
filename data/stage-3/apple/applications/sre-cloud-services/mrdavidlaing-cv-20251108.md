## Additional Context

My experience operating infrastructure at scale includes production deployment of Kubernetes, Redis, and Elasticsearch. Given my background with distributed systems, I am confident I would learn Cassandra, Zookeeper, and Kafka quickly.

I welcome a conversation to explore whether my experience operating infrastructure at scale aligns with the Cloud Services SRE role—or perhaps another opportunity within Apple's Dublin engineering organization as roles evolve.
