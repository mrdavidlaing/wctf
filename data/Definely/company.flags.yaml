missing_critical_data:
- question: What is the actual funding runway in months?
  why_important: At this career stage, need 12+ months runway minimum to avoid pivot
    chaos
  how_to_find: Ask CFO or finance team directly during interviews about cash position
    and burn rate
  mountain_element: mountain_range
- question: What is manager span of control? How many direct reports per engineering
    manager?
  why_important: Managers with >6 reports have no bandwidth for career development
    or technical guidance
  how_to_find: Ask about team structure, org chart, typical manager/IC ratios during
    team interviews
  mountain_element: daily_climb
- question: What percentage of time is spent in meetings vs maker time?
  why_important: Need <30% meeting time to do deep technical work effectively
  how_to_find: Ask team members to share their actual calendar for a typical week
  mountain_element: daily_climb
- question: How often can engineers deploy to production? Same-day or weekly cycles?
  why_important: Deployment friction directly impacts ability to iterate and validate
    technical decisions
  how_to_find: Ask about deployment process, CI/CD pipeline, and last deployment time
    during technical interviews
  mountain_element: chosen_peak
- question: Are AI/LLM coding tools (GitHub Copilot, Cursor, etc.) approved and encouraged?
  why_important: Essential for competitive advantage and engineering velocity in 2025
  how_to_find: Ask about development tooling policies and what tools engineers actually
    use daily
  mountain_element: chosen_peak
- question: Do staff engineers participate in technical strategy or just implementation?
  why_important: Want to be advisor not order-taker at this experience level
  how_to_find: Ask about recent examples where senior ICs influenced product/technical
    direction
  mountain_element: story_worth_telling
- question: What is the on-call rotation structure and frequency?
  why_important: Always-on incident response kills sustainability and work-life balance
  how_to_find: Ask about incident response, pager duty rotation, typical incident
    frequency
  mountain_element: daily_climb
- question: What percentage of engineering time goes to new features vs maintenance/tech
    debt?
  why_important: Need balance - all greenfield is chaos, all maintenance is boring
  how_to_find: Ask product and engineering leads about roadmap split and how tech
    debt is prioritized
  mountain_element: story_worth_telling
- question: What timezone are most engineering and product meetings held in?
  why_important: Dublin timezone (GMT) working with US West Coast teams means early
    morning or late evening meetings
  how_to_find: Ask about team distribution, core hours, typical meeting times during
    interviews
  mountain_element: daily_climb
- question: Why is there no public engineering presence (blog, GitHub, conferences)?
  why_important: Could signal enterprise-sales focus OR could signal insular culture
    that doesn't value external engagement
  how_to_find: Ask about technical community involvement policies, if engineers are
    encouraged to speak/write externally
  mountain_element: chosen_peak
- question: What happened to the employees who gave negative Glassdoor reviews?
  why_important: Small review sample - did complainers leave voluntarily or get pushed
    out?
  how_to_find: Cannot ask directly - triangulate through LinkedIn to see if there
    are ex-employees with short tenures
  mountain_element: rope_team_confidence
- question: What is typical tenure for senior engineers? How many have >2 year tenure?
  why_important: High senior eng turnover signals either growth problems or cultural
    fit issues
  how_to_find: Ask about team tenure during interviews, check LinkedIn for ex-employees
