# CORRECTION NOTE (2025-10-30):
# Roxanne's mention of "another layoff" could not be verified through exhaustive research.
# No evidence found in: layoff trackers, tech news, Blind, Glassdoor, LinkedIn, or company data.
# Headcount grew 28% from 230 (Dec 2023) to 302-311 (Oct 2025), indicating hiring not laying off.
# Possible explanations: (1) Confusion with Spotify layoffs, (2) Multiple tranches within July 2023,
# (3) Misinterpretation of sales org voluntary turnover. See 20251030-layoff-analysis-correction.md.
