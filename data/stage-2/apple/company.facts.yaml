  critical_context: Apple's main Irish operations are in Cork (6,000+ employees, European
    HQ since 1980). Dublin is a new 2024 engineering expansion with 'several hundred'
    employees expected.
  strengths:
  - "Exceptional financial stability - no layoffs, \u20AC250M+ recent investments"
  - Legitimate software engineering work on critical Apple services (not just support)
  - 'Modern tech stack: Python, Go, Rust, Kubernetes, Kafka, Spark'
  - Global team collaboration with major engineering hubs
  - 10-year lease signals long-term commitment through 2034+
  - Strong compensation ratings (4.2/5)
  - Comprehensive benefits package
  - Established company with 44+ years in Ireland
  concerns:
  - 'Lower employee satisfaction: 3.7/5 Dublin vs higher global average'
  - Only 62% would recommend to friend (vs 79% globally)
  - New office means less established team culture vs Cork
  - Limited promotion opportunities mentioned in reviews (temporary rotations required)
  - Strict rules and policies cited as negatives
  - 3 days/week mandatory office attendance
  - Unclear reporting structure (Dublin to Cork or independent)
  verdict: VIABLE WITH CAVEATS - Exceptional stability and legitimate engineering
    work, but lower satisfaction than global Apple average and new office means less
    established culture
