Dear Hiring Manager,

I am applying for the Site Reliability Engineer position (Role 200566030-0562) on the Cloud Services Infrastructure team in Dublin.

At Mechanical Orchard, the mainframe modernization platform required building cloud infrastructure across GCP and AWS while handling multi-language release engineering and Kubernetes operations. Over the last year, I have been leveraging LLM coding agents to scale the amount of DevOps work I can accomplish, building automation for infrastructure provisioning and creating communication and distributed decision-making tooling that enables coordination across teams.

At Shopify, we faced the challenge of maintaining platform reliability during Black Friday/Cyber Monday peak traffic processing $3.5M/minute across 3 million merchant stores. I worked with the platform engineering team to implement proactive monitoring and incident response procedures that maintained SLOs throughout the event. Separately, the data warehouse team had no formal reliability practice for their 100PB data lake. I applied SRE principles including error budgets and SLI/SLOs to data quality and pipeline reliability, establishing observability frameworks for pipelines processing petabytes daily.

At Pivotal, there was no SRE function for Cloud Foundry platform products serving enterprise customers globally. I built the Dublin SRE team from scratch and collaborated with Google SRE engineers to implement SLI/SLO design and error budget frameworks for pivotaltracker.com (1M active users) and charity donation platforms processing £1B+ annually. When enterprise customers experienced deployment friction during platform upgrades, I worked with product teams to analyze upgrade challenges through data-driven analysis and eliminated deployment blockers. I scaled the LogSearch open-source project to process 2TB daily log ingest for Pivotal Web Services using Elasticsearch on BOSH-managed infrastructure.

At VMware, product teams across R&D lacked visibility into how customers were using their software. I built a telemetry data platform processing product telemetry across the Tanzu product portfolio using Python, Dagster, BigQuery, and Apache Impala. This created data-driven feedback loops that enabled strategic decisions across business units.

At City Index, the trading platform lacked centralized log aggregation and search capabilities. I led the LogSearch open-source project using Elasticsearch on BOSH-managed infrastructure deployed to AWS, which became City Index's first cloud-native trading platform component. I contributed AWS Spot instance support to Cloud Foundry BOSH, enabling cost-optimized infrastructure orchestration for bare-metal fleet management at scale. My experience includes operating Kubernetes, Redis, Elasticsearch, and Cloud Foundry in production. I work with Golang, Python, Terraform, and Bash for infrastructure automation and have established CI/CD pipelines and TDD practices across engineering organizations.

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my experience with SRE practices, distributed systems, and fleet management aligns with this role.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,
David Laing
