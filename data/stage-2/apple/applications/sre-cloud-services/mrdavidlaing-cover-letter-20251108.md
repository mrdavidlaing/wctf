Dear Hiring Manager,

I'm applying for the Site Reliability Engineer position on Apple's Cloud Services Infrastructure team in Dublin. With 25 years building reliable systems at hyperscale, I'm ready to contribute to the platform powering iCloud and Apple's backend services.

I contributed AWS Spot instance support to Cloud Foundry BOSH while at Pivotal - the open-source infrastructure orchestration tool for bare-metal fleet management. This work required understanding provisioning automation, hardware lifecycle management, and orchestration at scale. Combined with my Terraform expertise and experience operating Kubernetes in production, I bring directly relevant technical background for managing large-scale server fleets.

At Shopify, I maintained platform reliability during $3.5M/minute peak traffic (Black Friday/Cyber Monday) and pioneered data reliability practices for our 100PB data warehouse. At Pivotal, I built the SRE team from scratch and collaborated directly with Google SRE engineers on SLI/SLO design and error budget implementation for pivotaltracker.com (1M active users) and charity donation platforms processing £1B+ annually. At VMware, I built a telemetry data mart processing product data with Python, Dagster, BigQuery, and Apache Impala.

I work across language ecosystems suited to infrastructure challenges: Terraform/Golang/Bash for DevOps automation, Python/SQL for data engineering, TypeScript for tooling interfaces. I've operated Kubernetes, Redis, Elasticsearch, and Cloud Foundry in production at scale. Given my background with distributed systems, I'm confident I'd learn your specific stack (Cassandra, Zookeeper, Kafka) quickly. I've established CI/CD pipelines, TDD practices, and observability frameworks across engineering organizations.

What excites me about this role is Apple's approach: combining open-source technologies (Kubernetes, Cassandra) with proprietary services at exabyte scale. The opportunity to have "tremendous individual responsibility" over infrastructure affecting hundreds of millions of users aligns with how I work best.

Over the last year, I've increasingly integrated LLM-based agents into my workflow for code generation and automation. This multiplies my parallel execution capacity while maintaining reliability standards - creating headroom to tackle larger, more complex infrastructure challenges. I'm looking to apply this amplified capacity to Apple-scale problems, aligned with Apple's mandate for engineering teams to leverage AI tooling effectively.

I'd welcome a conversation to explore whether my experience and interest in applying LLM-augmented reliability engineering aligns with this Cloud Services SRE role - or perhaps another opportunity within Apple's Dublin engineering organization as needs evolve.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,
David Laing
