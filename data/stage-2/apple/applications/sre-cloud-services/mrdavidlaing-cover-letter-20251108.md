**Apple Services Engineering**
Cloud Services SRE Team
Dublin, Ireland

**RE: Site Reliability Engineer - Role 200566030-0562**

---

Dear Hiring Manager,

I'm writing to express my strong interest in the Site Reliability Engineer position on Apple's Cloud Services Infrastructure team in Dublin. The opportunity to build and operate the platform that powers iCloud and Apple's backend services - at exabyte scale, serving hundreds of millions of users - represents exactly the kind of impactful, technically challenging work I'm looking for.

What makes my candidacy unique: I'm an AI-augmented Staff SRE who brings not just 25+ years of experience, but a team of specialized AI assistants that amplify my infrastructure work. While I provide strategic direction and maintain oversight, AI agents handle specialized tasks like code generation, analysis, and automation - multiplying engineering velocity while maintaining the reliability standards critical to Apple's infrastructure.

## AI-Augmented SRE at Massive Scale

Throughout my 25+ year career, I've specialized in building and operating reliable infrastructure at scale - and recently pioneered AI-augmented SRE practices that multiply engineering effectiveness. Currently at Mechanical Orchard, I'm pioneering AI agent orchestration for Kubernetes/Terraform automation, creating environments where AI agents collaborate and self-correct while I maintain strategic oversight. At Shopify, I maintained platform reliability during $3.5M/minute peak traffic (Black Friday/Cyber Monday), pioneered data reliability engineering practices for our 100PB data warehouse, and began developing AI-augmented workflows where AI agents handle specialized technical tasks under human oversight. At VMware, I built a telemetry data mart processing product data using Python, Dagster, BigQuery, and Apache Impala. At Pivotal, I built our SRE team from scratch and collaborated directly with Google SRE engineers on SLI/SLO design and error budget implementation.

This background aligns directly with your team's focus on operating critical infrastructural systems at hyperscale - structured and unstructured storage, caching, queueing, and searching systems that store exabytes of data and serve millions of users.

## Infrastructure Automation & Fleet Management

I have extensive experience with the exact technical challenges your role describes. At Pivotal, I contributed AWS Spot instance support to Cloud Foundry BOSH, the open-source infrastructure orchestration tool. This work required deep understanding of fleet management, bare-metal operations, and automation at scale - directly relevant to managing Apple's large-scale server provisioning and maintenance.

My Kubernetes expertise includes working with the operator framework, controllers, and CRDs to build reliable, self-healing infrastructure. I've operated both Cloud Foundry and Kubernetes platforms at enterprise scale, applying configuration management tools (Ansible, Puppet) and building automation to eliminate toil through code and process improvements.

## SRE Principles & Reliability Engineering

What excites me most about this role is the team's emphasis on SRE as an engineering discipline. I'm passionate about error budgets, fault analysis, and using data-driven approaches to improve reliability. At Shopify, I established observability frameworks and SLIs for data quality. At Pivotal, I worked alongside Google SRE engineers to implement error budget practices for pivotaltracker.com (serving 1M active users) and critical charity donation platforms (processing £1B+ in donations).

I have a keen eye for opportunities to eliminate toil - whether that's building automation tools, instrumenting reliability systems, or improving processes. My experience spans monitoring and alerting at scale, incident response, and creating the kind of reliability tooling your team develops to protect platform uptime.

## Technical Fit

Your role emphasizes proficiency in Golang, Rust, and Python - languages I use daily. I have deep experience with the infrastructure services your platform depends on: Kubernetes, Cassandra, Zookeeper, Kafka, and Redis. My background includes DNS, DHCP, LDAP, server virtualization, and server monitoring in large-scale distributed systems that combine hardware, operating systems, and software - exactly what's needed to operate infrastructure at Apple's scale.

I'm well-versed in SDLC practices including continuous integration, TDD, and agile methodologies. These aren't just theoretical knowledge - they're practices I've established across engineering organizations and applied to build reliable systems.

## Why Apple & Dublin

I'm particularly drawn to the opportunity to have "tremendous individual responsibility and influence over the direction" of infrastructure that powers some of Apple's most visible features. The chance to work on systems that affect hundreds of millions of users daily, building the next generation platform for Apple's infrastructural services, is deeply motivating.

I'm based in Dublin and excited about the opportunity to contribute to Apple's growing Dublin engineering presence. The work your Cloud Services SRE team is doing - operating at exabyte scale, supporting iCloud and backend systems with modern open-source technologies - represents the perfect intersection of technical challenge, scale, and impact.

## What I Bring

Beyond technical skills and AI-augmented capabilities, I bring a collaborative leadership style honed from orchestrating work across 80+ R&D teams globally at Pivotal. I've built SRE teams from scratch, established reliability practices across organizations, and have a track record of driving shared outcomes through authentic collaboration and data-informed decision making.

I'm passionate about building reliable systems through automation and instrumentation - whether that automation comes from traditional code or AI-assisted workflows. I believe in long-term thinking over short-term fixes, fixing root causes over treating symptoms, and using structured decision-making frameworks to make better choices under pressure.

As an AI-augmented engineer, I offer Apple a force multiplier: the ability to tackle infrastructure challenges with both deep human expertise and AI-amplified execution speed. This combination of strategic thinking and accelerated implementation is particularly valuable when operating systems at the scale and complexity of Apple's Cloud Services infrastructure.

The opportunity to join Apple's Cloud Services SRE organization, contribute to systems operating at hyperscale, and help build the platform that powers critical Apple services is exactly the kind of technically challenging, impactful work I'm looking for.

I'd welcome the opportunity to discuss how my experience building and operating large-scale infrastructure, applying SRE principles, and automating reliability at companies like Shopify, VMware, and Pivotal can contribute to Apple's Cloud Services Infrastructure team.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,
David Laing
