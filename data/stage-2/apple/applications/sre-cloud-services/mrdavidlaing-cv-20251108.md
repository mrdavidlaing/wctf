## Why Apple Cloud Services SRE

I'm excited about this role because it combines areas where I've built deep expertise: operating infrastructure at massive scale (exabytes of data, hundreds of millions of users), applying SRE principles to complex distributed systems, building automation to eliminate toil, and pioneering AI-augmented engineering workflows.

As an AI-augmented Staff SRE, I bring a unique capability: a team of specialized AI assistants that amplify my infrastructure work. While I provide strategic direction and maintain oversight, AI agents handle specialized tasks like code generation, analysis, documentation, and automation - multiplying engineering velocity while maintaining reliability standards. This approach aligns with Apple's focus on innovation and efficiency at scale.

The opportunity to work on the platform that powers iCloud and Apple's backend services - using technologies like Kubernetes, Cassandra, Kafka, and Redis at hyperscale - aligns perfectly with my experience maintaining 100PB data warehouses, $3.5M/minute commerce platforms, and contributing to Cloud Foundry BOSH infrastructure orchestration.

I'm particularly drawn to the Cloud Services SRE organization's focus on fleet management, reliability tooling, and process improvement at scale. This matches my track record of building SRE teams from scratch, establishing error budget practices with Google SRE engineers, and pioneering both data reliability engineering and AI-augmented SRE practices.

The chance to have "tremendous individual responsibility and influence" over critical infrastructure serving hundreds of millions of users is exactly the kind of impactful work I'm looking for in Dublin.
