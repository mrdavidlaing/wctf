synthesis:
  mountain_worth_climbing: 'MAYBE'
  sustainability_confidence: MEDIUM
  overall_assessment: 'Complex trade-offs - exceptional comp/stability vs cultural/organizational
    concerns'
  key_insights:
  - 'STRONG POSITIVES: Exceptional compensation (base + equity), zero layoff risk,
    Apple brand credential, AI tools available'
  - 'STRONG POSITIVES: Good DORA metrics, smooth shipping despite scale, modern tech
    stack, SRE discipline'
  - 'CONCERNING: Dublin is satellite office (6 months old) playing catchup to US West
    Coast decisions'
  - 'CONCERNING: Highly siloed teams with no official org chart, chaotic cross-team
    coordination (intentional design)'
  - 'CONCERNING: Secrecy via "code level" clearance prevents cross-team learning and
    collaboration'
  - 'CONCERNING: Culture favors deep specialization over generalist breadth - may
    not suit 25-year senior engineer'
  - 'CONCERNING: Limited scope of impact due to narrow specialization (hardware vs
    software classes of problems)'
  - 'CONCERNING: Career ceiling at Staff/Team Lead in Dublin, advancement requires
    US relocation'
  - Insider (James Wynne, similar profile) gave lukewarm "maybe" when asked if he'd
    join today
  decision_factors:
  - 'MAJOR GREEN: Compensation, stability, zero layoff risk, Apple brand, AI tools,
    DORA metrics, benefits'
  - 'MAJOR RED: Satellite office dynamics, extreme silos, secrecy barriers, narrow
    specialization, limited Dublin advancement'
  - 'Cultural fit question: James (who likes being socially connected) experiences
    frustration with silos and "cog in machine" feeling'
  next_steps:
  - This is a MAYBE - strong financial/stability upside vs cultural/organizational
    concerns
  - Key decision point - does exceptional comp + zero layoff risk outweigh satellite
    office frustrations?
  - Consider personal priorities - financial security vs scope of impact and collaboration
  - Silos and satellite status are structural Apple design choices unlikely to change
  - Dublin team immaturity (6 months) means processes still forming - could improve
    or worsen
