synthesis:
  mountain_worth_climbing: 'NO'
  sustainability_confidence: LOW
  overall_assessment: 'Energy Matrix analysis reveals unsustainable profile - fails both critical thresholds with 35% burnout work and severe organizational coherence violations. Exceptional comp cannot offset severe energy drains.'

  energy_matrix_analysis:
    predicted_daily_distribution:
      mutual_green: "25-35%"
      sparingly_yellow: "30-40%"
      burnout_red: "30-45%"
    threshold_results:
      mutual_threshold: "≥60% required"
      mutual_actual: "25-35%"
      mutual_verdict: "FAIL - Less than half of required sustainable work"
      burnout_threshold: "≤20% maximum"
      burnout_actual: "30-45%"
      burnout_verdict: "FAIL - Nearly double acceptable burnout level"
      yellow_threshold: "≤30% combined"
      yellow_actual: "30-40%"
      yellow_verdict: "MARGINAL - At upper limit"
    energy_sustainability_rating: "POOR"
    sustainability_confidence: "HIGH - Based on insider validation of structural issues"

  key_insights:
  - 'ENERGY MATRIX VERDICT: 30-45% burnout work (need ≤20%) + only 25-35% mutual work (need ≥60%) = unsustainable'
  - 'SEVERE DRAIN: Organizational coherence violation - uncertain_problem_space + wide_timezone_spread + no_async_first = structural mismatch'
  - 'SEVERE DRAIN: Satellite office creates misalignment (blocks progress core need) - "information in fits and spurts", no decision authority'
  - 'SEVERE DRAIN: Silos block glue_work (expert strength) and aligned_collaboration (strong generator) - latent conflicts from unclear boundaries'
  - 'MODERATE DRAIN: Authority ambiguity pervades (no org chart, unclear ownership) - violates need for structured processes'
  - 'GREEN FLAG: 25-35% mutual work (SRE practices, AI tools, some infrastructure) provides some energy generation'
  - 'GREEN FLAG: Good DORA metrics, smooth shipping, modern tech stack when scope permits'
  - 'GREEN FLAG: Exceptional compensation and zero layoff risk mitigates financial anxiety drain'
  - 'YELLOW FLAG: 30-40% sparingly work (deep specialization, timezone collaboration) - good at it but draining'
  - 'CRITICAL: James Wynne (similar profile, same frustrations) gave lukewarm "maybe" - real-world validation of energy drain prediction'

  decision_factors:
  - 'ENERGY SUSTAINABILITY: Fails both thresholds - 30-45% burnout (need ≤20%), 25-35% mutual (need ≥60%)'
  - 'STRUCTURAL ISSUES: Silos, satellite status, secrecy are intentional Apple design choices - will not change'
  - 'ORGANIZATIONAL COHERENCE: Severe mismatch between uncertain_problem_space work mode and wide_timezone_spread + sync_heavy culture'
  - 'CORE NEEDS BLOCKED: Visible progress (core need) blocked by satellite dynamics, aligned collaboration (strong generator) blocked by silos'
  - 'EXPERT STRENGTHS WASTED: Glue work expertise actively blocked by secrecy and silos - using only 30% of capability'
  - 'FINANCIAL TRADE-OFF: Exceptional comp + zero layoff risk vs 35% burnout work - money cannot buy back energy'
  - 'INSIDER VALIDATION: James Wynne experiencing exact predicted frustrations after 6 months - not theoretical'
  - 'TEAM IMMATURITY: 6-month-old team still finding ownership - current 35% burnout could worsen before improving'

  next_steps:
  - 'RECOMMENDATION: DECLINE - Energy Matrix shows unsustainable profile that would lead to burnout'
  - 'Even exceptional compensation cannot offset 30-45% burnout work and severe organizational coherence violations'
  - 'Structural issues (silos, satellite status, secrecy) are intentional design choices that will not change'
  - 'Your core need for visible progress and strong generator of aligned collaboration are blocked by environment'
  - 'Expert strength in glue work is actively prevented by secrecy and silos - would be underutilized and frustrated'
  - 'Insider with similar profile experiencing predicted frustrations validates Energy Matrix analysis'
  - 'Better to find role with ≥60% mutual work that leverages glue work strength and provides aligned collaboration'
  - 'Financial security is important but not worth sacrificing 25 years of career capital to burnout risk'
