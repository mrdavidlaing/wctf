    - flag: Small Glassdoor sample size (21-30 reviews) limits statistical confidence
        despite excellent 4.6/5 rating
      impact: Small sample means outlier experiences less visible; harder to assess
        true culture breadth
      confidence: Medium - cross-referenced with Comparably (NPS 100), Blind (4.5/5),
        95% retention rate supports ratings
    - flag: Some reviews mention promotion difficulties and developing hierarchy despite
        flat structure claims
      impact: Potential gap between stated flat structure and career advancement reality
        for Staff+ roles
      confidence: Low - implied from organizational descriptions, but 95% retention
        suggests most satisfied

    dealbreakers: []
    concerning:
    - flag: Interview process takes weeks to months with only 42% positive Glassdoor
        rating (difficulty 3.2/5)
      impact: Lengthy hiring process (6 stages, 2-3 paid projects totaling 10-30 hours)
        may indicate slower decision-making culture
      confidence: High - documented on 'How We Hire' page, though projects are paid
        and respectful of candidate time
    - flag: 27+ countries with no core hours could create timezone coordination challenges
      impact: Extreme distribution may make realtime collaboration difficult for some
        teams
      confidence: Medium - depends on specific team distribution; async-first culture
        may mitigate

missing_critical_data:
- question: What is the actual compensation range for Staff Software Engineer roles?
  why_important: Need to verify if remote-first equal pay matches or exceeds market
    rates for senior roles
  how_to_find: Levels.fyi data, Glassdoor salary reports, or direct inquiry during
    interview
  mountain_element: mountain_range
- question: What backend technologies are used beyond Perl? Any modernization efforts?
  why_important: Critical for backend engineers to understand tech stack evolution
    and learning opportunities
  how_to_find: Technical interview questions, engineering blog posts, or insider conversations
  mountain_element: chosen_peak
- question: How does the Career Advisor system work in practice for promotions to
    Staff+?
  why_important: Flat structure could mean unclear advancement; need concrete examples
    of Staff+ career paths
  how_to_find: Ask about promotion criteria and timeline in interviews; request to
    speak with Staff+ engineers
  mountain_element: rope_team_confidence
- question: What are the core engineering challenges at DuckDuckGo scale (100M searches/day)?
  why_important: Understand if technical problems are interesting/challenging enough
    for Staff+ engagement
  how_to_find: Technical deep-dive interviews, engineering blog, or insider technical
    discussions
  mountain_element: story_worth_telling
- question: How does remote-first work at 335 people across 27 countries? Timezone
    distribution?
  why_important: Verify if 'no core hours' creates collaboration friction or truly
    enables flexibility; understand realignment ability
  how_to_find: Ask about team collaboration patterns, meeting cadences, async communication
    practices, team timezone distribution
  mountain_element: daily_climb
- question: What percentage of engineering budget goes to maintaining Perl stack vs
    new development?
  why_important: High maintenance burden could limit innovation time and new feature
    velocity
  how_to_find: Engineering roadmap discussions, team allocation questions in interviews
  mountain_element: chosen_peak
- question: What is DuckDuckGo's AI/ML strategy beyond current offerings (DuckAssist,
    Duck.ai)?
  why_important: Understand if AI work is strategic priority or defensive move; future
    growth area for senior engineers
  how_to_find: Product roadmap questions, AI team hiring, strategic direction from
    leadership
  mountain_element: chosen_peak
- question: How are conflicts resolved in flat DRI structure? What happens when DRIs
    disagree?
  why_important: Flat structures need clear conflict resolution mechanisms; critical
    for realignment ability
  how_to_find: Ask specific scenario questions about past conflicts, escalation paths,
    decision authority boundaries
  mountain_element: rope_team_confidence
- question: What does the team coordination style look like in practice? Alpine, Expedition,
    or hybrid?
  why_important: Need to validate coordination style matches terrain and that realignment
    ability exceeds change rate
  how_to_find: Ask about last 2-3 priority shifts, how communicated, realignment timeline,
    decision-making process
