    dealbreakers: []
    concerning:
    - flag: Tiny market share (0.54% global, 1.96% US) despite growth vs Google's
        92.45% dominance
      impact: Small player status could limit long-term viability if Google aggressively
        defends privacy space
      confidence: High - Backlinko and Statista market share data, but 10+ years profitability
        suggests sustainable niche
    - flag: TrustPilot rating low at 2.2/5 (538 reviews) citing limited results, slow
        performance, US-biased results
      impact: Product quality concerns from users could indicate technical limitations
        or UX gaps
      confidence: Medium - TrustPilot skews negative; app store ratings strong (4.5/5,
        50M+ downloads)
  chosen_peak:
    dealbreakers: []
    concerning:
    - flag: Core search engine written in Perl (legacy technology from 2008 founding)
      impact: Limited learning opportunities in modern backend technologies for search
        team; may affect hiring/retention
      confidence: High - Wikipedia confirms Perl stack, but mobile/browser teams use
        modern stacks (Kotlin/Swift/TypeScript)
    - flag: Limited public technical conference presence and deep engineering blog
        content
      impact: Fewer external-facing technical visibility opportunities for building
        profile
      confidence: Medium - FOSDEM 2019 found, podcast appearances, but less than peers;
        strong open source presence compensates
  rope_team_confidence:
    dealbreakers: []
    concerning:
    - flag: Small Glassdoor sample size (21-30 reviews) limits statistical confidence
        despite excellent 4.6/5 rating
      impact: Small sample means outlier experiences less visible; harder to assess
        true culture breadth
      confidence: Medium - cross-referenced with Comparably (NPS 100), Blind (4.5/5),
        95% retention rate supports ratings
    - flag: Some reviews mention promotion difficulties and developing hierarchy despite
        flat structure claims
      impact: Potential gap between stated flat structure and career advancement reality
        for Staff+ roles
      confidence: Low - implied from organizational descriptions, but 95% retention
        suggests most satisfied
  daily_climb:
    dealbreakers: []
    concerning:
    - flag: Interview process takes weeks to months with only 42% positive Glassdoor
        rating (difficulty 3.2/5)
      impact: Lengthy hiring process (6 stages, 2-3 paid projects totaling 10-30 hours)
        may indicate slower decision-making culture
      confidence: High - documented on 'How We Hire' page, though projects are paid
        and respectful of candidate time
    - flag: 27+ countries with no core hours could create timezone coordination challenges
      impact: Extreme distribution may make realtime collaboration difficult for some
        teams
      confidence: Medium - depends on specific team distribution; async-first culture
        may mitigate
