  why_important: 30% reduction in Sept 2024 may have damaged culture - need current

    with survivors
- mountain_element: rope_team_confidence
  question: JP Phillips departure context and orchestration system continuity
  why_important: Key technical departure signal - need to know if voluntary (better

  how_to_find: LinkedIn outreach to JP Phillips, ask hiring manager during interview,
    insider interview
- mountain_element: rope_team_confidence
  question: Current engineering org structure and reporting lines
  why_important: Need to understand authority clarity and decision-making speed post-layoffs
    (authority_ambiguity is moderate severity drain)
  how_to_find: Request org chart during interview process, ask about team structure
