    - flag: Career opportunities rated 4.1/5 (lowest of all Glassdoor metrics). Small
        team may limit advancement paths
      impact: Limited promotion opportunities due to small size. May need to create
        your own growth vs climbing ladder
      confidence: High - Glassdoor employee reviews
    - flag: Small team (39 engineers) may limit scope of complex coordination challenges
        at staff level
      impact: Less opportunity for large-scale system design or multi-team orchestration
        typical of staff engineer work. Trade-off between impact per engineer vs organizational
        complexity
      confidence: Medium - Inferred from team size
    - flag: 70% churn rate acknowledged by CEO (compensated by high volume)
      impact: High churn may indicate product stickiness challenges or pricing pressure.
        While volume compensates financially, constant customer acquisition could
        create pressure.

    - flag: Paid test task (10 hours) + '3 hell-yeah approvals' required - rigorous
        hiring may limit flexibility

- question: What is the geographic distribution of the engineering team? Where are
    the 39 engineers located (timezones)?
  why_important: Critical for evaluating timezone coordination fit. You prefer Europe/US
    East Coast presence and need realtime collaboration ability to exceed terrain
    change rate
  how_to_find: Ask recruiter or hiring manager for team timezone heatmap. Request
    to speak with engineers in different timezones
  mountain_element: daily_climb
- question: What does the custom Python framework look like? Why not use standard
    Flask/Django?
  why_important: Need to understand if this is brilliant tailored tooling or technical
    debt trap. Impacts learning curve and maintenance burden
  how_to_find: Ask CTO Gonçalo Silva or backend engineers in interview. Request code
    samples or architectural overview
  mountain_element: chosen_peak
- question: What does staff engineer scope look like with only 39 engineers? What's
    the career ladder?
  why_important: At 25 years experience, need to understand if there's meaningful
    technical leadership work or if you'd be 'just another engineer' due to small
    team size
  how_to_find: Ask about staff engineer career path, current staff engineers and their
    projects. Request engineering levels doc
  mountain_element: story_worth_telling
- question: How does the team realign when priorities shift? What's the actual coordination
    style - alpine, expedition, established route?
  why_important: Need to understand if coordination style matches terrain demands
    and if realignment ability exceeds change rate. Critical for v3.1 framework
  how_to_find: Ask about last 2-3 direction changes, how they were communicated, how
    long realignment took. Ask engineers about decision-making process
  mountain_element: rope_team_confidence
- question: What does 'housekeeping day' look like in practice? Is it protected time
    or first thing cut when deadlines loom?
  why_important: Verify that technical debt prioritization is real vs aspirational.
    Tests organizational maturity around sustainable pace
  how_to_find: 'Ask engineers: ''Tell me about your last housekeeping day - what did
    you work on?'' Ask if anyone has skipped it due to pressure'
  mountain_element: chosen_peak
- question: What's the engineering manager span of control? How many reports does
    a manager typically have?
  why_important: You want managers with ≤6 reports who have bandwidth for 1-on-1s
    and career development. Small team might mean healthier ratios or 'everyone reports
    to CTO'
  how_to_find: Ask about org structure, manager ratios, who you'd report to and their
    current team size
  mountain_element: rope_team_confidence
- question: What's the actual compensation range for senior/staff engineers? What's
    total comp structure?
  why_important: Formula-based compensation is great for fairness, but need to know
    if it's market-competitive for your experience level and region
  how_to_find: Request salary range in first conversation. Ask about equity/profit-sharing
    structure if any
  mountain_element: daily_climb
- question: What customer churn mitigation strategies are in place? How has 70% churn
    changed since 2020?
  why_important: High churn could mean product quality issues, pricing problems, or
    feature gaps that engineering will be constantly firefighting. Need current data
  how_to_find: Ask product leadership or CEO for current retention metrics, what's
    been learned since 2020 quote
