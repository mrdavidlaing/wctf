missing_critical_data:
- question: What is current profitability/EBITDA and cash flow situation?
  why_important: Need to assess actual financial_anxiety vs debt service capacity.
    Growing revenue but massive debt could mean burn.
  how_to_find: Request in recruiter screen, check insider interviews, search for analyst
    reports
  mountain_element: mountain_range
- question: How are new C-suite leaders (CTO Pratik Wadher, CRO Anthony Anzevino)
    actually performing?
  why_important: Authority_ambiguity severity depends on whether new leaders are stabilizing
    or adding chaos.
  how_to_find: Insider interviews with engineers who report up through CTO, check
    glassdoor reviews post-Sep 2025
  mountain_element: rope_team_confidence
- question: What was the real reason for Apr 2024 terminations?
  why_important: Determines if scapegoating is cultural pattern or isolated incident.
    Affects interpersonal_conflict risk.
  how_to_find: Insider interviews with survivors, LinkedIn outreach to terminated
    employees
  mountain_element: rope_team_confidence
- question: How is Cooper AI actually built vs marketed? Is it truly proprietary or
    repackaged 3rd party?
  why_important: If vaporware/POC theater, reduces green flag value. If real, validates
    innovation investment.
  how_to_find: Technical deep-dive in interviews, request architecture review, check
    patent filings
