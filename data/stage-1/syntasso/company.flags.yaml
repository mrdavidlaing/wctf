synthesis:
  mountain_worth_climbing: MAYBE
  sustainability_confidence: MEDIUM
  organizational_health: Level 2 - Healthy Growth
  coordination_style_assessment: Likely EXPEDITION style (small team, rapid pivots,
    founder-led)
  coordination_match: MODERATE - expedition style works for early-stage, but UK timezone
    creates coordination drag
  realignment_ability: HIGH - founders proven at CloudCredo exit, small team can pivot
    quickly
  verdict: |
    **Strong technical fit with geographic and revenue model risks.**

    **GREEN SIGNALS:**
    - Exceptional founding team (CloudCredo exit, Pivotal/VMware pedigree)
    - Perfect technical alignment (Go/K8s platform engineering)
    - Massive market timing (platform eng wave, 24% CAGR)
    - Enterprise proof point (NatWest production use)
    - Strong OSS culture and CNCF leadership
    - Sustainable practices (35-hour week, research days)
    - $7M funding with multi-year runway

    **YELLOW SIGNALS:**
    - Revenue model unproven (still transitioning OSS → paid)
    - Customer count and concentration unknown
    - UK timezone centered (5-8hr offset from US)
    - Small team size (exact headcount unclear)
    - 13 months since last funding (runway clock)

    **RISK PROFILE:**
    Early-stage startup risk (Level 2 healthy growth, but revenue model maturing). Not for risk-averse.
    Geographic coordination challenge for US-based remote. Strong technical opportunity if
    willing to navigate timezone async work and startup uncertainty.

    **RECOMMENDATION:**
    **CONDITIONAL PROCEED** - Advance to conversation phase to de-risk:
    1. Revenue metrics (ARR, customer count, conversion rates)
    2. US timezone remote reality (any US employees? Meeting schedule?)
    3. Compensation + equity details
    4. Series A timeline and funding pressure

    If revenue showing traction (>$1M ARR, >5 customers, >10% OSS→paid conversion) and
    US remote works for someone → **strong opportunity**. If revenue still minimal and
    UK-only team → **pass** (geographic + financial risk too high).
  energy_sustainability_rating: MEDIUM
  energy_sustainability_notes: |
    Estimated energy distribution for Level 2 (Healthy Growth) with specific Syntasso factors:

    **GREEN (Productive Work): 60-65%**
    - Core platform engineering (40-50%)
    - OSS contribution (10-15%)
    - Conference speaking (5-10%)

    **YELLOW (Coordination): 25-30%**
    - Timezone coordination overhead (5-10%)
    - Customer success support (10-15%)
    - Multi-role glue work small team (10-15%)

    **RED (Defensive): 10-15%**
    - Revenue model uncertainty navigation (5-10%)
    - Future fundraising pressure (5%)

    Early-stage startup typical for this profile. Not burnout territory but requires
    tolerance for ambiguity and coordination overhead. Sustainable if US remote works
    and revenue model proves out in next 12 months.
  key_decision_factors:
  - Revenue traction (ARR, customer count, OSS→paid conversion)
  - US timezone remote reality and async collaboration effectiveness
  - Compensation competitiveness vs US market rates
  - Personal tolerance for early-stage startup risk and ambiguity
  - Value of UK/EMEA market access vs US timezone preference
