    - flag: Company explicitly stated 'not profitable' with LLM bills as biggest expense
        and 'more paying customers = more money lost' (Sept 2024)
      impact: Unit economics are fundamentally broken. Growth creates losses. Existential
        risk if not fixed during Series B runway.
      confidence: High - company blog post explicitly acknowledged problem

      confidence: High - TechCrunch and company blog confirm
      severity: Medium
      task_implications: []

      confidence: High - team size vs user base from multiple sources
      severity: Medium
      task_implications: []
    - flag: No reviews on Glassdoor, Blind, or Indeed - no transparency into work
        culture
      impact: Flying blind on actual work experience. Can't validate work-life balance
        or management quality claims.

      task_implications: []
    - flag: Uses DirectX 11 (Windows), Vulkan (Linux), Metal (macOS) - complex cross-platform
        graphics stack

      severity: Medium
      task_implications: []
    - flag: Board expanded to 8 members post-Series B - potential for investor pressure

  daily_climb:
    dealbreakers: []
    concerning:
    - flag: Early-stage startup pace + broken unit economics + financial pressure

      severity: Low
      task_implications: []
  story_worth_telling:
    dealbreakers: []
    concerning:
    - flag: Developer tools are notoriously hard to monetize - Atom was free, VS Code
        is free
      impact: Structural challenge in market. Developers expect free tools. Path to
        sustainable business unclear.
      confidence: High - industry pattern well-established

      task_implications: []
    - flag: If company fails, equity is worthless and timeline on resume may be seen
        as red flag by some
      impact: Career risk if startup craters. Short tenure harder to explain than
        multi-year run.
      confidence: Medium - startup failure is common risk
      severity: Low
      task_implications: []
missing_critical_data:
- question: What is the current runway in months post-Series B, and what metrics are
    required to raise Series C or reach profitability?
  why_important: Need to understand financial stability timeline and exit velocity
    expectations. If runway <12 months, significantly higher risk.
  how_to_find: 'Ask CEO or CFO directly in interview. Red flag if evasive. Also ask:
    what needs to be true for next round?'
  mountain_element: mountain_range
- question: What specific steps are being taken to fix unit economics? What is timeline
    to profitability?
  why_important: Company said more customers = more money lost. Need concrete plan,
    not hope. This is existential. Vague answers are massive red flag.
  how_to_find: 'Ask CEO/CTO: ''Your blog said LLM costs unsustainable. What''s the
    plan?'' Look for: model efficiency, pricing changes, cost-sharing, alternative
    models.'
  mountain_element: mountain_range
- question: What is current revenue run rate, customer breakdown (free vs paid), and
    revenue growth trajectory?
  why_important: Validate monetization is working post-Sept 2024 pricing change. Growth
    without revenue is not sustainable.
  how_to_find: Ask CEO/CFO directly. May not share exact numbers but should share
    trends. 'Growing X% MoM' or 'X% convert to paid'. Stonewalling is red flag.
  mountain_element: mountain_range
- question: What does realistic work-life balance look like? What are crunch time
    expectations and frequency?
  why_important: Early-stage + financial pressure + broken unit economics = potential
    burnout. Need honest assessment from engineers, not recruiting pitch.
  how_to_find: 'Ask engineers directly: ''Walk me through typical week. Last time
    you worked weekend? How often vacation?'' Ask about on-call and incidents.'
  mountain_element: daily_climb
- question: What is compensation band for Staff/Principal level, including equity
    details (strike price, valuation, dilution)?
  why_important: Can't make informed decision without understanding economics. Early
    equity can be worthless or life-changing. Need to calculate scenarios.
  how_to_find: 'Ask recruiting for range. For equity: ask CFO for 409A valuation,
    outstanding shares, Series C dilution expectations. Model at various exits.'
  mountain_element: daily_climb
- question: What is product roadmap for next 12-24 months? What are the big technical
    challenges ahead?
  why_important: 'Need to know if work will be interesting vs shipping features. Want
    hard problems: distributed systems, GPU programming, language design.'
  how_to_find: 'Ask CTO/engineering for roadmap. Ask about tech debt, architecture
    changes, research areas. Look for: GPUI improvements, CRDT enhancements, AI model
    work.'
  mountain_element: chosen_peak
- question: How is technical decision-making done? What is RFC/design doc process?
    How much autonomy do senior engineers have?
  why_important: At senior level, need authority to drive direction, not just execute.
    Want collaborative but not consensus-paralysis or founder bottleneck.
  how_to_find: 'Ask: ''Walk me through how major architectural decision gets made.
    Who has veto? How handle disagreements?'' Review public RFCs if available.'
  mountain_element: chosen_peak
- question: What are customer retention and churn metrics? Are users sticky or trying
    and leaving?
  why_important: 150k MAU is great but are they retained or churning? High churn means
    not sticky enough vs VS Code. Need evidence of growing retention.
  how_to_find: 'Ask CEO/Product: ''What''s cohort retention Day 1/7/30/90?'' and ''Top
    reasons users churn to VS Code?'' Honest answer = credibility.'
  mountain_element: mountain_range
- question: What is team coordination style? Alpine, expedition, established route,
    orienteering, or trail crew? Does this match the terrain volatility?
  why_important: Coordination style-terrain mismatch kills sustainable excellence.
    Need to understand if team bandwidth matches decision needs.
  how_to_find: Ask about decision process, sprint planning, deployment frequency,
    handling unexpected issues, team tenure, recent pivots.
  mountain_element: chosen_peak
- question: What is realignment ability? Can team pivot faster than terrain changes?
    Evidence of past pivots?
  why_important: Startups face constant terrain shifts. Need team that can coordinate
    route changes quickly. Stuck teams fail when terrain shifts.
  how_to_find: Ask about past strategic pivots (open source, pricing model were big
    ones). How fast did team execute? How much debate/resistance?
