        notes: Rapid scaling triggers authority_ambiguity moderate drain. Uses glue_work

          to navigate chaos.

    - flag: Multi-geography expansion - 6 offices across 5 countries with hybrid work
      impact: Offices in London, Sunnyvale, Vancouver, Yokohama, Leonberg (Germany),
        Herzliya (Israel). Timezone spread from PST to JST creates coordination overhead.
        Hybrid work model adds complexity. Risk of async/sync misalignment per profile
        needs.
      confidence: High - Office locations documented
      task_implications:
      - task: Coordinate across wide timezone spread (PST to JST, 16-hour difference)

        notes: Wide timezone_spread with sync_heavy creates overhead. Uses glue_work
          strength. Profile notes 'uncertain problem space + wide timezone + sync
          culture = severe drain' - autonomous driving IS uncertain, so this is a
          risk area.

    - flag: Technical risk - Unproven end-to-end approach in safety-critical domain
      impact: Wayve's approach (no 3D maps, no hand-coded rules) is novel but unproven
        at scale. Competitors like Waymo have 100K+ robotaxi rides/week. Regulatory
        approval uncertain. Risk of pivot if approach doesn't scale.
      confidence: Medium - Market position vs competitors
      task_implications:
      - task: Manage risk that novel technical approach may not achieve regulatory
          approval or scale

        notes: Technical uncertainty is part of frontier research (MOARE when aligned),
          but regulatory/market risk adds stress without using core strengths directly.

- question: What is the specific UK visa sponsorship policy? Do they sponsor Skilled
    Worker visas for EU candidates?
  why_important: UK is not in EU, requires separate work authorization. Critical for
    any EU-based candidate considering London roles.
  how_to_find: Ask recruiter directly in first conversation, check UK government sponsor
    list
  mountain_element: daily_climb
- question: Can the 2 'Location Flexible' roles (Head of Parking, Product Release
    Manager) be performed from EU locations?
  why_important: Only potential path to EU remote work, needs explicit confirmation
  how_to_find: Direct outreach to recruiter or hiring manager about geographic flexibility
  mountain_element: daily_climb
- question: What is the equity compensation range and strike price for senior engineer
    level?
  why_important: Given £4.43B valuation, need to understand if equity is meaningful
    or just table stakes
  how_to_find: Ask during offer negotiation, check levels.fyi for Wayve data if available
  mountain_element: story_worth_telling
- question: What percentage of engineering time is spent on research vs production
    systems?
  why_important: Balance between cutting-edge research and building production-ready
    autonomous driving
  how_to_find: Ask in team interview, inquire about typical project split
  mountain_element: chosen_peak
- question: What is the path to profitability timeline? When do they expect first
    significant revenues?
  why_important: Pre-revenue with 2027 deployment is clear, but when does revenue
    become material?
  how_to_find: May not be publicly disclosed, ask leadership during interview about
    commercialization roadmap
  mountain_element: mountain_range
- question: What is typical tenure for senior engineers? What does career progression
    look like?
  why_important: Employee reviews mention unclear progression, need concrete examples
  how_to_find: Ask hiring manager for examples, LinkedIn research on employee tenure
  mountain_element: rope_team_confidence
- question: How many mandatory office days per week for 'hybrid' London roles?
  why_important: Hybrid can mean 1 day/week or 4 days/week - drastically different
    experiences
  how_to_find: Ask recruiter explicitly in first conversation
  mountain_element: daily_climb
- question: What is the TypeScript usage in the codebase? Full-stack roles mentioned
    but tech stack details limited.
  why_important: Candidate prefers TypeScript, unclear if this is used beyond Python/C++
  how_to_find: Ask in technical interview, review job descriptions for web/full-stack
    roles
  mountain_element: chosen_peak
- question: What are the actual compensation bands for senior engineers in London
    vs Germany vs US?
  why_important: Glassdoor reviews mention compensation opacity, need transparent
    numbers
  how_to_find: Ask recruiter for salary range in first call, check levels.fyi
  mountain_element: daily_climb
- question: Are there any plans to expand EU remote work or open additional EU offices?
  why_important: Current state is dealbreaker, but future plans might be relevant
    for long-term consideration
  how_to_find: Ask recruiter or leadership during interview process
  mountain_element: daily_climb
- question: What is the current burn rate and runway to profitability?
  why_important: With £62M losses and no revenue, understanding runway is critical.
    £1.32B raised but rapid hiring could accelerate burn. Need to know if 2-3 years
    of runway or 6-12 months.
  how_to_find: Ask in interview about financial planning, runway, and path to revenue.
    Check for Series D fundraising activity.
  mountain_element: mountain_range
- question: How is the organization handling rapid scaling? Are there defined career
    paths and compensation bands?
  why_important: Glassdoor mentions 'unclear salaries/career progression' and 'messy
    management'. With 3x headcount growth, need to know if HR/management processes
    are catching up.
  how_to_find: Ask about organizational structure, career ladders, compensation philosophy.
    Ask how decisions are made and communicated.
  mountain_element: rope_team_confidence
- question: What is the async-first vs sync-heavy culture with 6 global offices?
  why_important: Profile requires either 'async_first_culture' OR 'co_located' for
    uncertain problems. Autonomous driving is uncertain. Wide timezone spread (PST
    to JST) with sync-heavy would be severe drain.
  how_to_find: Ask about communication norms, meeting culture, async documentation
    practices. Ask how decisions are made across timezones.
  mountain_element: daily_climb
- question: What is the regulatory pathway and timeline to commercial deployment?
  why_important: Nissan integration is FY2027 (2+ years). Uber trials just starting.
    Need clarity on when Wayve expects revenue and what regulatory milestones remain.
  how_to_find: Ask about regulatory strategy, safety validation timeline, and commercial
    roadmap. Review UNECE Reg 171 involvement.

    key_energy_insights:
    - 57% moare work uses core strengths (systems_thinking, tool_building, infrastructure_automation)
      while energizing
    - Open source PostgreSQL work aligns with tool_building core need and visible_progress
      generator
    - One meeting per week culture fits communication preference (max 30%, ideal 20%)
    - Remote-first distributed model supports async_work_capability (strong) and timezone_flexibility
    - 43% sparingly from hyper-growth scaling pains and organizational immaturity
    energy_concerns:
    - Hyper-growth (553% valuation, 300% user growth) triggers misalignment drain
      during rapid scaling
    - Small team (127 people) managing 1M databases likely means high operational
      burden and on-call intensity
    - Financial opacity (no revenue disclosure) and young company (2020) create uncertainty
      drains
    - Unknown compensation, development practices, and career progression add authority_ambiguity
      drain
