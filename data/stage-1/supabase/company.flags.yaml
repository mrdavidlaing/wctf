    - Open source PostgreSQL work aligns with tool_building core need and visible_progress
      generator

    - 37% sparingly from hyper-growth scaling pains and organizational immaturity
    energy_concerns:
    - Hyper-growth (553% valuation, 300% user growth) triggers misalignment drain
      during rapid scaling
    - Small team (127 people) managing 1M databases likely means high operational
      burden and on-call intensity
    - Financial opacity (no revenue disclosure) and young company (2020) create uncertainty
      drains
