missing_critical_data:
- mountain_element: daily_climb
  question: What is the actual remote work policy for software engineers at The Dock
    innovation center specifically?
  why_important: The Dock appears to be the premier technical environment, but unclear
    if it follows same restrictive project-dependent remote policy
  how_to_find: 'Ask during interview: ''What percentage of engineers at The Dock work
    remotely? Is there a required office presence?'''
- mountain_element: story_worth_telling
  question: What is the typical career progression timeline from Staff Engineer to
    Senior Engineer to Principal at Accenture Ireland?
  why_important: Need to understand realistic promotion path given concerns about
    opaque 'people lead' system
  how_to_find: 'Ask hiring manager: ''What does the career ladder look like for technical
    roles? What''s the typical timeline and criteria for each level?'''
- mountain_element: rope_team_confidence
  question: How will the September 2025 restructuring (5 units → 1) specifically affect
    engineering roles and reporting structure?
  why_important: Massive org change could mean manager changes, team disruption, or
    role elimination
  how_to_find: 'Ask: ''How has your team been impacted by the recent restructuring?
    Have there been any changes to reporting lines or team structure?'''
- mountain_element: daily_climb
  question: What is the salary range for this specific Staff Engineer role, and is
    there negotiation room?
  why_important: Published averages show €45K (far below market), but actual offers
    may vary; need to know if negotiable to €60-70K minimum
  how_to_find: 'Ask directly in HR/recruiter conversation: ''What is the salary range
    for this position?'' and negotiate firmly toward market rate'
- mountain_element: chosen_peak
  question: Which specific project/client would I be assigned to, and what is the
    technical stack and work arrangement?
  why_important: Project assignment determines actual tech work, remote flexibility,
    and whether it's strategic vs BPO work
  how_to_find: 'Ask hiring manager: ''What project would I join? What technologies?
    What''s the remote work arrangement for that specific project?'''
- mountain_element: rope_team_confidence
  question: How has this specific team been affected by the ongoing layoffs through
    November 2025?
  why_important: Some teams may be growing while others shrinking; need to know if
    this team is stable or at risk
  how_to_find: 'Ask team members during interview: ''Has your team had any changes
    in size recently? How has the organization impacted your work?'''
- mountain_element: chosen_peak
  question: What percentage of Ireland engineering roles are software development
    vs BPO/content moderation work?
  why_important: Large content moderation presence in Ireland - need to understand
    if engineering roles are truly technical
  how_to_find: 'Ask: ''What type of work does the engineering team in Dublin focus
    on? Is this primarily software development or operations/support?'''
- mountain_element: mountain_range
  question: Are there any planned future reductions or hiring freezes for Ireland
    operations specifically?
  why_important: Ireland was hit disproportionately hard in 2023 (20% cut); need to
    know if more cuts planned
  how_to_find: 'Difficult to get honest answer, but ask: ''What are the growth plans
    for the Dublin office?'' and watch for evasive answers'
- question: What is the actual team coordination style in practice? Alpine (tight
    bandwidth), expedition (loose), established route (process-driven), orienteering
    (autonomous), or trail crew (maintenance)?
  why_important: Need to understand if coordination style matches uncertain AI/cloud
    terrain - rapid change requires tight feedback loops or strong async culture
  how_to_find: 'Insider interview: Ask about decision-making speed, meeting load,
    communication patterns, how quickly team can pivot when tech landscape shifts'
  mountain_element: chosen_peak
- question: What is the realignment ability? Can teams adapt faster than AI/cloud
    landscape changes, or do reorgs/layoffs slow adaptation?
  why_important: Critical for sustainable work in volatile technical terrain - if
    terrain changes faster than team can realign, creates burnout from constant misalignment
  how_to_find: 'Insider interview: Ask about recent pivots (e.g., Gen AI strategy),
    how long decisions take, whether reorg overhead prevents rapid iteration'
  mountain_element: chosen_peak
- question: What is manager tenure and span of control in Dublin? How many manager
    changes do engineers experience?
  why_important: Manager churn compounds other dysfunction - need to understand if
    2-3 changes per year (15-20% overhead) or worse
  how_to_find: 'Insider interview: Ask about manager stability, average tenure, how
    often reporting structure changes'
  mountain_element: rope_team_confidence

    verify if sustainable or burnout risk
  how_to_find: 'Insider interview: Ask about typical week''s meeting schedule, client
    vs internal meeting ratio'
  mountain_element: daily_climb
- question: How do layoffs actually happen? Performance-based, org-level cuts, or
    arbitrary? Is there psychological safety?
  why_important: Scapegoating culture vs honest execution challenges - affects whether
    environment is HELP (learning from failures) or BURNOUT (blame)
  how_to_find: 'Insider interview: Ask about how layoffs were communicated, whether
    performance reviews are fair, if people can safely raise concerns'
  mountain_element: rope_team_confidence
- question: What is the actual equity compensation for senior engineers in Dublin?
    RSUs, options, or none?
  why_important: Compensation gap might be offset by equity - need total comp picture
    to assess financial sustainability
  how_to_find: 'Insider interview: Ask about equity grants, vesting schedules, refresher
    policies'
  mountain_element: daily_climb
- question: What is the engineering-to-consulting ratio in Dublin office? Primarily
    engineering or client-facing work?

    of time on internal platforms vs client delivery'
  mountain_element: chosen_peak
- question: Are there deception patterns? Vaporware (demos vs real product), POC theater
    (paid POCs with no conversion), or honest execution challenges?

    demos represent real product capabilities, if engineering feels pressure to build
