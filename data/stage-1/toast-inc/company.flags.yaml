    key_energy_insights:
    - 72% moare work uses core strengths (systems_thinking, tool_building, infrastructure_automation)
      while energizing
    - Open source PostgreSQL work aligns with tool_building core need and visible_progress
      generator
    - One meeting per week culture fits communication preference (max 30%, ideal 20%)
    - Remote-first distributed model supports async_work_capability (strong) and timezone_flexibility
    - 28% sparingly from hyper-growth scaling pains and organizational immaturity
    energy_concerns:
    - Hyper-growth (553% valuation, 300% user growth) triggers misalignment drain
      during rapid scaling
    - Small team (127 people) managing 1M databases likely means high operational
      burden and on-call intensity
    - Financial opacity (no revenue disclosure) and young company (2020) create uncertainty
      drains
    - Unknown compensation, development practices, and career progression add authority_ambiguity
      drain
