missing_critical_data:
- question: What is the current cash runway and burn rate?
  why_important: Only $5M raised 10+ months ago with explosive growth claims - likely running out of money soon
  how_to_find: Ask during insider conversations or executive interview
- question: Why has there been no follow-on funding despite growth claims?
  why_important: Red flag if investors aren't backing explosive growth with more capital
  how_to_find: Ask founders directly or research investor sentiment
- question: What is the actual employee count and why is it inconsistent?
  why_important: Conflicting data (2-10 vs 49 vs 58) suggests organizational chaos or deliberate obfuscation
  how_to_find: Ask HR or look at LinkedIn employee list directly
