    dealbreakers: []
    concerning:
    - flag: Revenue ($15M) significantly behind headcount (168 employees) suggesting
        high burn rate
      impact: $15M ARR with 168 employees implies ~$89K revenue/employee, well below
        SaaS benchmarks ($150K-250K). With Series D funding, likely burning $50-100M/year.
        Unicorn valuation may not be sustainable without dramatic revenue acceleration.
      confidence: Medium - revenue from LeadIQ estimate, burn rate implied from funding
        rounds and growth trajectory
    - flag: 'Conflicting employee growth signals: -7% contraction vs growth from 160
        to 168'
      impact: One source (Growjo) shows -7% employee growth while official numbers
        show 160 (2023) to 168 (2025) growth. Could indicate recent efficiency efforts,
        layoffs, or data inconsistency. Needs clarification.
      confidence: Low - conflicting data sources, no official announcement about layoffs
        or restructuring
  chosen_peak:
    dealbreakers: []
    concerning:
    - flag: Organizational structure still maturing with 'changing strategy' feedback
      impact: Glassdoor reviews mention 'changing strategy' and 'lack of detailed
        structure/direction'. For 6-year-old company with 168 employees, suggests
        strategic direction still evolving. Could mean exciting flexibility or concerning
        thrashing.
      confidence: Medium - mentioned in reviews but small sample size (19 reviews
        total)
  rope_team_confidence:
    dealbreakers: []
    concerning:
    - flag: Very limited Glassdoor review sample (only 19 reviews total)
      impact: Only 19 Glassdoor reviews for 168-person company limits confidence in
        culture assessments. Could be hiding systemic issues or simply reflecting
        low review participation rate.
      confidence: High - verified 19 review count on Glassdoor
  daily_climb:
    dealbreakers: []
    concerning:
    - flag: Work-life balance rated 3.5/5 with 'everyone running hot' theme
      impact: Work-life balance rating 3.5/5 (below industry average ~3.8). Multiple
        reviews explicitly mention 'everyone running hot' and WLB challenges. High-intensity
        startup environment may not be sustainable long-term.
      confidence: Medium-High - consistent theme across multiple reviews, though small
        sample (19 total)
    - flag: Fast-paced environment with high autonomy requires self-sufficiency
      impact: Reviews mention 'lack of detailed structure/direction requiring self-sufficiency'.
        For senior ICs this could be autonomy paradise or isolation hell depending
        on personal preferences and support needs.
      confidence: Medium - mentioned in reviews but could be positive for right person
  story_worth_telling:
    dealbreakers: []
    concerning: []
missing_critical_data:
- question: What is the actual work-life balance on specific teams?
  why_important: Glassdoor reviews show concerning WLB issues (3.5/5, 'everyone running
    hot'), but could vary significantly by team. Critical for sustainable performance.
  how_to_find: Insider interviews with current engineers, ask about on-call rotation,
    sprint cadence, typical hours, vacation usage norms, team-specific culture
  mountain_element: daily_climb
- question: What does 'changing strategy' mean concretely?
  why_important: Reviews mention 'changing strategy' and 'lack of structure'. Could
    indicate healthy iteration or concerning thrashing. Need to understand impact
    on engineering roadmap stability.
  how_to_find: Interview with hiring manager and team members about recent strategic
    pivots, technical debt from strategy changes, current roadmap clarity
  mountain_element: chosen_peak
- question: What is the IC career ladder and Staff+ track like?
  why_important: Small company (168 people) may not have formal IC ladder. Need to
    understand growth path for senior ICs seeking Staff/Principal advancement.
  how_to_find: Ask about IC levels, recent IC promotions, number of Staff+ engineers
    on team, career development process, promotion criteria
  mountain_element: story_worth_telling
- question: What is the path to profitability and actual burn rate?
  why_important: $15M revenue with 168 employees suggests high burn rate (~$50-100M/year).
    Need to understand runway and path to profitability before next fundraise.
  how_to_find: Ask leadership about unit economics, gross margins, customer acquisition
    costs, path to profitability timeline during interviews
  mountain_element: mountain_range
- question: What caused the conflicting employee growth data (-7% vs growth to 168)?
  why_important: Conflicting data on employee growth. If real contraction, could indicate
    financial stress or strategic shift. Need accurate growth trajectory.
  how_to_find: Direct question to recruiter/hiring manager about recent team changes,
    any layoffs or restructuring, current growth plans
  mountain_element: mountain_range
- question: How does on-call and operational burden work for critical infrastructure?
  why_important: Infrastructure platform for critical systems (NYSE processing 1.1T
    records/day, top 5 banks) likely has significant on-call requirements. Need concrete
    expectations.
  how_to_find: Interview questions about incident response, on-call rotation schedule,
    escalation procedures, pager duty frequency, SLA requirements
  mountain_element: daily_climb
- question: What is the team coordination style in practice (alpine vs expedition
    vs orienteering)?
  why_important: 'Reviews suggest high autonomy but unclear structure. Need to assess
    coordination style fit: is it alpine (clear summit, figure out route), expedition
    (coordinated multi-team), or orienteering (finding the route together)?'
  how_to_find: Ask about project planning process, decision-making authority, cross-team
    coordination, documentation culture, how teams sync and align
  mountain_element: rope_team_confidence
- question: What is the equity package structure and realistic exit scenarios?
  why_important: $1B valuation sounds impressive but need to understand strike price,
    vesting schedule, liquidity options, and realistic acquisition/IPO timeline for
    equity to have value.
  how_to_find: Recruiter discussion on equity package details, research comparable
    exits (Confluent IPO at $11B, MemSQL/SingleStore, Cockroach Labs), ask about secondary
    market opportunities
  mountain_element: story_worth_telling
- question: What is the realignment capability when terrain shifts?
  why_important: Fast-growing company in emerging AI/ML infrastructure space will
    face terrain changes. Need to understand if team can coordinate route changes
    faster than terrain demands.
  how_to_find: Ask about recent examples of strategic pivots, how team adapted, decision-making
    speed, psychological safety for challenging direction, information transparency
