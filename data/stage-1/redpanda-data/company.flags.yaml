- question: What is the actual work-life balance on specific teams?
  why_important: Glassdoor reviews show concerning WLB issues (3.5/5, 'everyone running

    sprint cadence, typical hours, vacation usage norms, team-specific culture
  mountain_element: daily_climb
- question: What does 'changing strategy' mean concretely?
