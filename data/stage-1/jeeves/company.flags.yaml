missing_critical_data:
- question: Who is currently leading engineering after CTO departure in Jan 2024?
    What is the engineering leadership structure?
  why_important: CTO absence for 9+ months is major red flag - need to understand
    if there's strong interim leadership or if engineering is rudderless. Critical
    for 'strong technical culture' priority.
  how_to_find: Directly ask in interview about engineering leadership structure. Check
    LinkedIn for VP Engineering or other senior engineering leaders. Ask about reporting
    structure and decision-making.
  mountain_element: chosen_peak
- question: What are the engineering career levels and IC track? Is there a Staff/Principal/Distinguished
    IC path?
  why_important: 'Evaluator''s #1 priority is ''senior IC growth path without forced
    management transition'' - this is a dealbreaker-level question.'
  how_to_find: Ask hiring manager directly about IC career ladder. Request to speak
    with current Staff+ engineers. Ask about typical career progression for senior
    ICs.
  mountain_element: story_worth_telling
- question: What is current path to profitability? When is breakeven expected given
    $40M ARR as of 2023?
  why_important: Not yet profitable as of mid-2023 - need to understand if path to
    sustainability is clear or if there's risk of future cost-cutting/layoffs.
  how_to_find: Ask leadership about revenue growth trajectory, unit economics, and
    profitability timeline in interview. Research recent funding announcements or
    financial updates.
  mountain_element: mountain_range
- question: Why did CTO Arpan Nanavati leave after only 2 years? What were the circumstances?
  why_important: Short tenure + unfilled position for 9+ months suggests either hiring
    difficulty or organizational problems. Critical to understand root cause.
  how_to_find: Ask carefully in interviews about leadership transitions. Network with
    current/former employees. Check if Arpan has made any public statements.
  mountain_element: rope_team_confidence
- question: 'What are the engineering practices: CI/CD pipeline, testing culture,
    code review process, deployment frequency?'
  why_important: Need to assess engineering maturity and technical culture quality.
    Lack of visibility is concerning for senior IC role.
  how_to_find: Ask detailed questions in technical interviews about development workflow,
    testing practices, deployment process. Request to pair with engineers or see example
    PRs.
  mountain_element: chosen_peak
- question: What is the engineering team structure, size, and org chart? How many
    Staff+ engineers are there?
  why_important: Need to understand peer group for senior IC role and organizational
    structure for growth potential.
  how_to_find: Ask hiring manager for engineering org chart, team size breakdown.
    Request introductions to Staff+ peers during interview process.
  mountain_element: chosen_peak
- question: What is the team coordination style and how well does it match the multi-region,
    regulated fintech terrain demands?
  why_important: Complex terrain (22 countries, regulated BaaS infrastructure) requires
    strong coordination. Unknown style/fit is a risk.
  how_to_find: Ask about decision-making process, communication patterns, team autonomy
    vs escalation culture. Ask about examples of recent pivots or major technical
    decisions.
  mountain_element: chosen_peak
- question: What is current cash position and burn rate as of Q4 2024? What is current
    ARR?
  why_important: Financial data ends May 2024 - need updated metrics to assess ongoing
    financial health and runway.
  how_to_find: Ask in interview about recent financial performance. Research any recent
    press releases or funding announcements. Check with recruiter.
  mountain_element: mountain_range
- question: What are typical work hours and meeting load for senior engineers? What
    % of time is maker time?
  why_important: Work-life balance is key priority - need to understand actual day-to-day
    experience beyond 'remote flexibility'.
  how_to_find: Ask current engineers in backchannel or during interview process. Ask
    about meeting culture, on-call rotation, expectations.
  mountain_element: daily_climb
- question: What is the backend tech stack? (Python/Java/Go/Node.js?) What databases
    and infrastructure?
  why_important: Only know frontend stack (React/TypeScript) - need full picture to
    assess technical fit and interesting challenges.
  how_to_find: Ask in technical interview. Review job descriptions for specific technology
    mentions. Ask about architecture decisions.

synthesis:
  mountain_worth_climbing: 'NO'
  sustainability_confidence: MEDIUM
  overall_assessment: 'Jeeves is a NO based on two critical dealbreakers: (1) Poor
    engineering leadership - CTO departed January 2024 after only 2 years, position
    unfilled for 9+ months, with employee reviews explicitly citing "challenges with
    product and engineering leadership". This directly conflicts with the requirement
    for "strong technical culture with experienced engineering leadership". (2) Lack
    of EU timezone overlap - majority of engineering is in LATAM (São Paulo 32%, Mexico
    City 32%, Bogotá 16%) with only 14% US Remote, creating significant collaboration
    challenges for EU-based work. While the financial fundamentals are solid (no layoffs,
    3+ years runway, revenue growth) and the technical challenges are interesting
    (multi-region BaaS infrastructure), these positives cannot overcome the engineering
    culture and timezone mismatch dealbreakers.'
  key_decision_factors:
  - Engineering leadership is fundamentally broken - CTO vacancy for 9+ months with
    employee complaints is disqualifying
  - EU timezone incompatibility makes effective collaboration impossible
  - These two dealbreakers override any positive financial or technical aspects
  recommended_next_steps:
  - Do not pursue this opportunity
  - Archive as reference case for identifying engineering leadership red flags
  - Use timezone distribution analysis for future company evaluations
