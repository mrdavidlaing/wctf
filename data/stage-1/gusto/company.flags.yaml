- question: What is the actual engineering culture regarding decision-making autonomy
    and meeting intensity?
  why_important: Profile requires low meeting intensity (max 30%, ideal 20%) and high
    autonomy for sustainable energy. This is critical for determining if daily work
    environment matches needs.
  how_to_find: Ask engineers during insider interviews about typical meeting load,
    decision-making process speed, amount of independent work time, and whether meetings
    are mostly async-friendly or sync-heavy.
  mountain_element: daily_climb
- question: How stable is the current organizational structure post-layoff in Feb
    2023?
  why_important: Authority ambiguity is a moderate drain for profile - need clarity
    on team structure and decision authority to avoid latent conflicts. Layoff was
    2 years ago so structure should be settled.
  how_to_find: Ask about organizational changes in past 18 months, team structure
    stability, clarity of ownership/responsibilities, and whether reporting lines
    have been consistent.
  mountain_element: rope_team_confidence
- question: What is the breakdown between infrastructure/platform work vs feature
    development vs technical debt?
  why_important: Profile energized by infrastructure/tool building, drained by constant
    context switching and unclear priorities. Need to understand actual time allocation
    to assess energy sustainability.
  how_to_find: Ask engineers about typical sprint composition, tech debt allocation,
    balance between platform vs product work, and whether infrastructure gets dedicated
    time or is always reactive.
