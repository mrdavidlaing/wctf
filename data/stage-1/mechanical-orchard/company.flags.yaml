  organizational_level_description: "Terminal Decline - customer loss + sales failure + vaporware + panic pivot = death spiral"

  primary_strengths:
    - "18 months runway for orderly wind-down or acquisition"
    - "Remote-first culture still maintained (for now)"
    - "European presence if company survives (unlikely)"

  primary_risks:
    - "Level 5 Terminal Decline - classic startup death spiral in motion"
    - "Vaporware construction (20-25% time) - soul destroying moral injury work"
    - "Sales failure: zero new customers in 2+ years of operation"
    - "Customer concentration killed them (lost 1 of 2 customers = 50% revenue)"
    - "POC theater (15-20% time) - running POCs with no conversion ability/intent"
    - "Strategy thrashing (20-25% time) - services → product panic pivot"
    - "Scapegoating culture (10-15% time) - Head of Sales termination during crisis"
    - "Financial anxiety (10-15% time) - ongoing survival stress"
    - "Founder pedigree discount: Rob Mee's past success ≠ current execution failure"
    - "Kent Beck departure during crisis (canary fled coal mine)"

    vaporware_detected: true
    vaporware_time_pct: "20-25%"

  energy_sustainability: LOW
  energy_sustainability_rationale: "75.3% SPARINGLY + 24.7% BURNOUT = 100% draining quadrants. Zero MOARE work. Vaporware construction creates moral injury.
