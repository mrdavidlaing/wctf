- question: What are the engineering team's CI/CD practices, code review standards,

- question: What is the actual meeting load and maker time availability for senior
    engineers?
  why_important: Profile indicates 20-30% ideal meeting load, max 30%. Exceeding this
    creates energy drain and reduces productive work time.
  how_to_find: 'Insider interview: Ask about weekly meeting hours, focus time policies,
    meeting-free days, async vs sync culture'

- question: What is the specific tech stack for platform/infrastructure engineering
    roles (container orchestration, observability, IaC tools)?
  why_important: Need to assess learning curve and alignment with infrastructure automation
    expertise. High learning required can be drain vs energizer depending on specific
    technologies.
  how_to_find: 'Insider interview: Ask about infrastructure stack, deployment pipelines,
    observability tools (Datadog/Prometheus/etc), IaC adoption (Terraform/Pulumi)'

- question: How does the sales org challenge (38.6% quota attainment) impact engineering
    priorities and roadmap stability?
  why_important: Sales pressure can create misalignment drain through constant pivots,
    urgent feature requests, or blame culture. Need to understand engineering/sales
    boundary.
  how_to_find: 'Insider interview: Ask about product roadmap stability, how sales
    requests are prioritized, recent examples of sales-driven changes'

- question: What was the rationale and integration plan for Aim Security acquisition
    (Sept 2025)?
  why_important: M&A integration can create authority ambiguity, cultural conflict,
    technical debt. First acquisition creates uncertainty about integration competence.
  how_to_find: 'Insider interview: Ask about integration timeline, cultural fit, technical
    overlap/synergy, team structure changes'
  mountain_element: rope_team_confidence
- question: What are the engineering team's CI/CD practices, code review standards,
    and testing frameworks?
  why_important: Staff engineer needs to understand quality gates, autonomy level,
    and technical rigor expectations. Absence of this info creates uncertainty about
    daily work quality.
  how_to_find: 'Insider interview: Ask about deployment frequency, code review process,
    test coverage expectations, incident response practices'

- question: What is the company's policy on AI coding tools (GitHub Copilot, Claude
    Code, etc.)?
  why_important: Impacts daily productivity and learning. Restrictive policies create
    friction; supportive policies amplify tool-building strengths.
  how_to_find: 'Insider interview: Ask about approved AI tools, procurement process,
    security/compliance constraints'
  mountain_element: chosen_peak
- question: What is the team coordination style and how does it match the terrain
    demands (alpine/expedition/established/orienteering)?
  why_important: Misalignment between coordination style and terrain creates severe
    energy drain (profile lists as severe drain). Need to assess communication bandwidth,
    decision authority, realignment ability.
  how_to_find: 'Insider interview: Ask about decision-making speed, autonomy level,
    how team adapts to changing requirements, recent pivots and how they were handled'
  mountain_element: chosen_peak
- question: What are typical compensation ranges for staff engineer level, including
    base, equity, and bonus?
  why_important: Below-market compensation creates financial anxiety drain (profile
    lists as moderate drain). Need to assess if total comp is competitive.
  how_to_find: 'Insider interview: Ask about comp philosophy, equity grant sizes,
    refresh cadence. Check levels.fyi for market data.'
