    Claude, etc. in their workflow?
  why_important: AI tools significantly impact developer productivity and modern engineering
    practices
  how_to_find: 'Ask in interview: ''What is the company policy on AI coding assistants
    like Copilot, Cursor, or Claude? Are engineers encouraged to use them?'''

- question: What is the current stock price and how has it performed since IPO? What
    is the equity value proposition?
  why_important: Post-IPO stock performance affects equity compensation value and
    upside potential
  how_to_find: 'Research: Check NASDAQ:AFRM current price, compare to IPO price ($49),
    look at historical performance. Ask: ''What is the equity story and growth potential?'''

- question: What is the specific nature of the 'toxic VP culture' and internal politics?
    Which VPs/orgs are involved?
  why_important: CRITICAL for evaluating interpersonal conflict exposure - this is
    a SEVERE energy drain trigger. Need to understand if this affects platform/infrastructure
    org or isolated to other areas.
  how_to_find: Insider interviews with current/former engineers, specific questions
    about leadership dynamics, which VPs have reputation issues, whether conflict
    is witnessed in meetings/all-hands
  mountain_element: rope_team_confidence
- question: What is the actual meeting load percentage for platform/infrastructure
    engineers? How much maker time vs meeting time?
  why_important: Need to validate whether remote-first actually means async-friendly
    or just Zoom-heavy sync culture. Meeting intensity >30% is incompatible with profile.
  how_to_find: Insider interviews asking about typical week structure, calendar analysis,
    team norms around sync vs async
  mountain_element: daily_climb
- question: How does the lack of CTO actually manifest? Who owns technical strategy
    and architecture decisions?
  why_important: Authority ambiguity creates latent conflict (moderate energy drain).
    Need to understand if this creates decision paralysis or empowers VPs/teams.
  how_to_find: Insider interviews about technical decision-making process, who has
    final say on architecture, how technical direction is set
  mountain_element: chosen_peak
- question: What coordination style does the platform/infrastructure team actually
    use? Alpine, expedition, established route, orienteering, trail crew?
  why_important: Need to assess whether team coordination matches terrain demands.
    Mismatch patterns create severe energy drain.
  how_to_find: 'Insider interviews asking about: decision autonomy, communication
    patterns (sync/async), planning cadence, how direction changes are handled, team
    tenure/shared context'
  mountain_element: chosen_peak
- question: How has the company culture changed post-layoffs? Is there visible rebuilding
    of trust or ongoing survivor anxiety?
  why_important: Two layoffs could mean either 'necessary correction, now stable'
    or 'ongoing uncertainty.' Big difference in energy drain.
  how_to_find: Insider interviews about morale, leadership messaging, whether hiring
    is aggressive or cautious, how survivors discuss the layoffs
  mountain_element: rope_team_confidence
- question: What is the actual comp range for Staff/Senior Staff infrastructure engineers
    in 2025?
  why_important: 4.4/5 benefits rating suggests above-market, but need numbers to
    eliminate financial anxiety drain. Market is ~$200K-$280K base for Staff in fintech.
  how_to_find: levels.fyi, insider interviews, job postings with ranges (CA required
    by law)
  mountain_element: daily_climb
- question: What is the relationship between SVP of Engineering (Geddes Munson) and
    President (Libor Michalek)? Who actually runs engineering day-to-day?
  why_important: Authority clarity - unclear reporting structure creates ambiguity
    drain
  how_to_find: Org chart from insider, LinkedIn research on reporting structure
  mountain_element: rope_team_confidence
- question: How did the Amazon partnership concentration get so high (25% GMV)? Is
    there active diversification strategy?
  why_important: Risk management - losing Amazon would be catastrophic. Need to know
    if leadership is taking this seriously.
  how_to_find: Insider interviews about strategic priorities, investor calls discussing
    diversification

synthesis:
  mountain_worth_climbing: MAYBE
  sustainability_confidence: MEDIUM
  overall_assessment: Affirm presents a compelling technical opportunity for ML/AI
    infrastructure work at scale with a mission-aligned product, but significant organizational
    concerns temper enthusiasm. The company has achieved an important financial milestone
    (profitability) and offers exactly the remote-first, modern data infrastructure
    role sought. However, recent layoffs, political culture complaints, and unclear
    technical leadership create meaningful risk. Best suited for senior engineers
    who prioritize technical challenges and can navigate organizational politics.
  key_decision_factors:
  - 'Technical match is excellent: ML at scale, modern data infrastructure (Iceberg,
    Snowflake), production AI systems'
  - 'Financial health improving: first profitable year, but high merchant concentration
    risk remains'
  - 'Cultural fit uncertain: remote-first and compensation are strong, but politics
    and limited growth noted'
  - 'Leadership stability mixed: long-tenured CEO but no CTO, recent layoffs, executive
    transitions'
  - 'Mission alignment strong: building honest financial products without predatory
    fees'
  recommended_next_steps:
  - Deep dive interview questions about technical leadership structure post-CTO departure
  - Probe on internal politics and how it manifests day-to-day for Senior Staff Engineers
  - Understand equity compensation and stock performance since IPO (AFRM stock price
    vs $49 IPO)
  - Talk to current Senior Staff/Distinguished Engineers about career growth reality
    vs framework
  - Assess specific team's culture and manager quality - may vary significantly across
    org
  - Research Amazon partnership stability given Walmart loss - what is retention strategy?
  comparison_questions:
  - How does the ML infrastructure sophistication compare to other options (e.g.,
    Stripe, Databricks, fintech startups)?
  - Is the organizational politics worth tolerating for the technical opportunity?
  - How does total comp (base + equity) compare given stock performance?
  - Is the career growth limitation acceptable given interesting technical work?
  - Does the mission alignment outweigh the merchant concentration risk?
