- question: What is the actual meeting load and maker time protection for senior engineers?
  why_important: Critical for productivity - need <30% meeting time confirmed with
    actual calendars, not vague 'collaborative' language
  how_to_find: 'Ask in Layer 2 conversations: ''Show me your typical weekly calendar''
    and ''How much protected maker time do you have?'''

    how long from PR merge to production?'''

    have?'' and ''What''s typical team size?'''
  mountain_element: rope_team_confidence
- question: How did the 2023 layoffs specifically impact engineering? Which projects
    were killed?
  why_important: Need to understand whether engineering budget was protected or disproportionately
    cut, and what strategic pivots occurred
  how_to_find: 'Ask engineers who survived: ''What changed after the layoffs?'' and
    ''What projects were cancelled?'''

- question: What are specific compensation bands for staff+ engineers at Spotify?
  why_important: At 25 years experience, need to know if comp is competitive with
    market (Meta, Google, etc.) or significantly below
  how_to_find: Levels.fyi for Spotify, ask recruiters directly for band, negotiate
    based on competing offers

- question: How does the co-CEO structure actually work in practice? Who decides what?
  why_important: Co-CEO models often create confusion and slow decision making - need
    clarity on decision rights

    co-CEO input - how was it resolved?'''

    for 2026?'' and ''Is headcount growing or flat?'''

- question: Are there specific teams or locations with better/worse work culture given
    the 20% reduction?
  why_important: Large orgs are heterogeneous - some teams may be energized, others
    burned out post-layoffs
  how_to_find: Network with multiple engineers across different teams, ask about team
    morale and turnover

- question: What is the staff+ engineer career track? IC7+? Distinguished Engineer
    paths?
  why_important: At 25 years, need clear path to continue growing as IC without forced

    look like here?'' and ''Can you introduce me to a Staff+ IC?'''

    hiring plans
  mountain_element: rope_team_confidence
- question: How will the co-CEO model affect engineering culture and decision-making?
