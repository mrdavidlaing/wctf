    - flag: Wide timezone distribution (global team) with Microsoft sync-heavy culture

missing_critical_data:
- question: What is the integration timeline and plan for GitHub into Microsoft CoreAI?
  why_important: CEO departure with no replacement represents fundamental organizational
    change. Integration depth, timeline, and impact on autonomy/culture critical for
    decision-making. Need to know if this is 6-month or 2-year process.
  how_to_find: Ask hiring manager and team members during interviews, reach out to
    recent GitHub employees on LinkedIn, monitor Microsoft CoreAI org announcements,
    ask about reporting structure changes
  mountain_element: mountain_range
- question: What is current team capacity and workload given Blind reviews about teams
    'stretched thin'?
  why_important: Multiple recent reviews mention top performers doing work of entire
    teams post-layoffs. This directly impacts work-life balance (top priority) despite
    official unlimited PTO policy. Need to verify team-specific reality.
  how_to_find: 'During interviews, ask team members: current sprint capacity, on-call
    rotation frequency, weekend work expectations, backlog size vs team velocity,
    recent burnout or turnover on team'
  mountain_element: daily_climb
- question: What is the senior IC career path and promotion process, especially during
    Microsoft integration?
  why_important: Organizational transition may freeze promotions or shift to Microsoft
    leveling system (L59-L80). Career growth is key priority for senior engineer role.
    Need to understand if IC track to Principal/Staff exists and is active.
  how_to_find: Ask hiring manager about IC track to Principal/Staff/Distinguished
    levels, recent promotion examples on team, how Microsoft integration affects career
    progression, if switching to Microsoft levels
  mountain_element: story_worth_telling
- question: What is the specific tech stack and project for this Ireland/EU remote
    role?
  why_important: GitHub has 2M LOC Rails monolith, but also newer AI/ML services and
    projects. Tech stack alignment (Rails maintenance vs AI/ML innovation) affects
    role attractiveness and career development opportunities.
  how_to_find: Request detailed job description from recruiter, ask about specific
    team and project during screen, whether it's Rails monolith work or AI/ML Copilot
    features or new services
  mountain_element: chosen_peak
- question: How does Microsoft CoreAI integration affect GitHub's remote-first culture
    and European presence?
  why_important: Microsoft historically more office-centric than GitHub. Integration
    could change remote work expectations (more synchronous meetings, office preference)
    or European hiring priorities. EU data residency investment may or may not continue.
  how_to_find: Ask about remote work policy changes during integration, talk to Microsoft
    CoreAI remote employees, ask if EU data residency investment continues, check
    if Ireland/EU hiring is growing or stable
  mountain_element: daily_climb
- question: What is current GitHub profitability and standalone financial health beyond
    revenue?
  why_important: Microsoft doesn't disclose GitHub profitability. If unprofitable
    despite $2B ARR, Microsoft could restructure further, deprioritize GitHub investments,
    or impose cost controls that affect engineering experience.
  how_to_find: Unlikely to get direct answer, but ask about investment levels in GitHub,
    team growth plans for 2025, budget for new initiatives, whether headcount targets
    are growing/flat/shrinking as proxy signals
  mountain_element: mountain_range
- question: What specific AI/ML projects and technologies would senior engineers work
    on?
  why_important: 'Copilot driving growth is known, but need details: fine-tuning infrastructure,
    multi-model routing, prompt engineering systems, RAG implementation, model evaluation
    frameworks. Specific tech determines learning opportunities.'
  how_to_find: Ask hiring manager and team about current AI/ML stack, whether using
    LangChain/LlamaIndex or custom frameworks, model serving infrastructure, and recent
    technical challenges
  mountain_element: chosen_peak
- question: What are integration plans?
  why_important: Need to understand timeline
  how_to_find: Insider interview
  mountain_element: mountain_range
- question: What are the specific plans and timeline for GitHub integration into Microsoft
    CoreAI?
  why_important: Integration structure will determine authority_ambiguity and alignment_clarity
    for next 12-18 months. Critical for assessing misalignment drain.
  how_to_find: Insider interview with GitHub engineering manager or recent Microsoft
    transfer
  mountain_element: mountain_range
- question: How has workload distribution changed post-layoffs? What is actual IC
    workload vs expectations?
  why_important: Blind reviews suggest top people doing work of entire teams - need
    to verify if this is localized or widespread burnout risk.
  how_to_find: Insider interview focusing on team staffing levels and sprint velocity
    changes
  mountain_element: mountain_range
- question: What is the actual meeting intensity and async vs sync culture balance
    today?
  why_important: Profile requires meeting_intensity ≤30%, needs fast_sync_decision_cadence
    OR async_first culture. Microsoft integration may shift this balance.
  how_to_find: Insider interview about typical week schedule, meeting load, decision-making
    processes
