    debt is prioritized
  mountain_element: story_worth_telling
- question: What timezone are most engineering and product meetings held in?
  why_important: Dublin timezone (GMT) working with US West Coast teams means early
    morning or late evening meetings
  how_to_find: Ask about team distribution, core hours, typical meeting times during
    interviews
  mountain_element: daily_climb
- question: Why is there no public engineering presence (blog, GitHub, conferences)?

    of IC to managers)?
  why_important: Understand reporting structure and span of control to assess authority
    ambiguity risk
  how_to_find: Insider interview with engineering leadership or current engineers
  mountain_element: rope_team_confidence
- question: How distributed is the engineering team across timezones? What are the
    core collaboration hours?
