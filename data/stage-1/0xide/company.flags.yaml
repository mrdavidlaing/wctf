  - question: How does the team handle technical disagreements and conflicting priorities?
    why_important: Profile shows severe drain from interpersonal conflict - need to
      understand conflict patterns
    how_to_find: Insider interviews about recent technical decisions, how disagreements
      resolved, escalation patterns

synthesis:
  organizational_health_level: 2
  organizational_health_rationale: 'Healthy Growth - Well-funded hardware startup with
    stable leadership, growing team (3.3x in 4 years), no layoffs, enterprise customers,
    strong technical culture. Not profitable but typical for capital-intensive hardware
    business with $100M Series B providing 3+ years runway.'
  mountain_worth_climbing: 'YES'
  sustainability_confidence: HIGH
  overall_verdict: 'STRONG MATCH - Excellent technical culture with Rust/open source,
    stable leadership team with deep systems expertise, solid financial position ($189M
    raised), real enterprise customers (not vaporware). Green flags strongly outweigh
    concerns. Primary risk is hardware business profitability timeline, but $100M
    runway provides cushion. Missing critical data about team coordination style and
    meeting culture, but strong indicators suggest healthy environment. Recommended
    to proceed with insider interviews to validate coordination fit and daily experience.'
  deception_patterns_detected: false
  deception_details: 'No theater patterns detected - real customers (LLNL, Idaho National
    Lab, CoreWeave), public open source code, active GitHub repositories with external
    contributions, and conference presence all indicate legitimate technical execution.'
  energy_matrix_summary: 'Estimated 65-70% productive work (Level 2 - Healthy Growth):
    Core systems programming in Rust (40-50%), open source contributions (30-40%),
    RFD participation (10-15%), supporting production deployments (15-20%), minimal
    reorg overhead (5%), minimal profitability uncertainty (5%). Conference participation
    adds 5% but is energizing (story worth telling). Strong alignment with profile
    strengths (systems thinking, tool building, infrastructure automation) and low
    conflict exposure makes this sustainable.'
  key_decision_factors:
    - 'Financial stability: $189M raised, $100M Series B, 3+ years runway'
    - 'Technical culture: Rust-first, open source, RFD process, strong engineering
      leadership'
    - 'Leadership stability: Founding team intact since 2019, no exec departures'
    - 'Real customers: Enterprise deployments at national labs and financial services,
      not POC theater'
    - 'Growth trajectory: 3.3x employee growth, no layoffs, actively hiring'
  next_steps:
    - Insider interviews to validate team coordination style and meeting culture
    - Clarify profitability timeline and business model sustainability
    - Understand manager ratios and team structure
    - Validate conflict resolution patterns and technical decision-making
    - Explore specific role scope and autonomy expectations
