- question: What is the actual team-specific work-life balance and on-call burden?
  why_important: Reviews show widespread work-life issues but experiences may vary
    by team. On-call expectations, weekend work frequency, and PTO approval rates
    could be significantly better on specific teams. This is make-or-break for a 25-year
    veteran prioritizing sustainability.
  how_to_find: 'Request to speak with 2-3 current staff engineers on the specific
    hiring team (not just manager). Ask directly: ''How often do you work weekends?'',
    ''What''s on-call rotation frequency?'', ''Have you had PTO requests denied?'',
    ''What time do you typically stop working?''. Check team-specific Glassdoor reviews
    if team is mentioned.'
  mountain_element: daily_climb
- question: What is the staff+ engineer turnover rate and departure reasons?
  why_important: High turnover of experienced engineers indicates culture incompatibility,
    limited growth, or work-life issues. Departure reasons reveal whether concerns
    are addressable. Company shows 20.9% overall growth but may be backfilling senior
    departures with juniors.
  how_to_find: Ask hiring manager directly for team's staff+ attrition rate over past
    18 months. Request LinkedIn back-channel with former staff engineers who left
    2024-2025. Check team composition history via LinkedIn to spot departures.
  mountain_element: rope_team_confidence
- question: How does the specific hiring manager approach work-life balance and technical
    decisions?
  why_important: Management quality rated 3.2/5 on Blind with reviews of 'terrible
    and short-sighted upper management', but experiences vary by manager. Direct manager
    has outsized impact on day-to-day experience. Manager's technical depth determines
    whether they understand complexity or 'get mad about timelines'.
  how_to_find: 'Multiple conversations with hiring manager probing: ''Tell me about
    a time your team missed a deadline - how did you handle it?'', ''How do you balance
    speed vs technical quality?'', ''What''s your policy on weekend work?'', ''How
    do you handle engineers who are burned out?''. Ask for skip-level conversation
    with manager''s manager.'
  mountain_element: rope_team_confidence
- question: What is the actual compensation offer structure (base vs equity split)?
  why_important: 'Reviews indicate 20-50% below-market base offset by equity. For
    25-year veteran likely with financial obligations, low base creates cash flow
    risk. Need specific numbers to evaluate: a 30% below-market base may be acceptable,
    50% may not be.'
  how_to_find: Request specific comp breakdown during offer stage. Use Levels.fyi
    to benchmark staff engineer at Samsara (appears to be L5-L6 range). Negotiate
    base salary aggressively given reviews of below-market base.
  mountain_element: daily_climb
- question: What is the team's approach to 'ship ship ship' pressure vs technical
    quality?
  why_important: Reviews cite cultural shift to 'ship ship ship mode' over thoughtful
    engineering. For staff engineer expected to set technical direction, need to know
    if team values architecture, technical debt management, and long-term thinking
    vs pure velocity.
  how_to_find: 'Ask hiring manager: ''How do you balance shipping quickly vs building
    for long term?'', ''Give example of when team said no to feature to pay down tech
    debt'', ''What''s your code review culture?''. Request to review team''s recent
    technical design docs to assess depth.'
  mountain_element: chosen_peak
- question: Is the role genuinely remote or are there hidden office expectations?
  why_important: Policy says remote-flexible, reviews say 'remote work deceptive as
    it enables overwork'. Need to validate that remote doesn't mean 'available 24/7'
    and that there's no informal pressure to be in office for advancement.
  how_to_find: 'Ask current staff engineers: ''Are you remote? How often do you go
    to office? Any pressure to be in office?''. Clarify with manager: ''What percentage
    of team is remote? Any expectation I attend office for key meetings/events? How
    does remote affect promotion?'''
  mountain_element: daily_climb
- question: What percentage of staff engineers successfully promote to senior staff/principal
    and on what timeline?
  why_important: Reviews cite slow promotions (3-4 years per level), hard promotion
    bar, engineers leaving for advancement. For staff engineer, want to understand
    path to senior staff/principal and whether it's achievable or a multi-decade grind.
  how_to_find: 'Ask manager: ''How many staff engineers on your team have promoted
    to senior staff in past 3 years? What does that typically take?'' Request to speak
    with recently promoted senior staff engineer about their path.'
  mountain_element: story_worth_telling
- question: How has the specific team's culture changed from 2023 to 2025?
  why_important: Company-wide reviews show sharp deterioration post-2023, but specific
    teams may have maintained better culture. If hiring team avoided the 'ship ship
    ship' shift and maintains work-life balance, they're an island of green in a sea
    of red flags.
  how_to_find: 'Ask team members with 3+ years tenure: ''How has the team culture
    changed since 2023? What''s better? What''s worse?'' Look for concrete examples,
    not vague positivity. Team that acknowledges company-wide changes but describes
    how they''ve protected their culture is ideal.'
