Meeting Title: Tom McDonagh / Stripe Recruiter Call
Date: Dec 4

Transcript:
 
Them: Hey, david.  
Me: Tom 3.  
Them: How's it going?  
Me: Good. Thank you. Apologize again for missing our chat on. Tuesday.  
Them: I'll go. Oh, God. These things happen. Don't worry about it. You're working from home today.  
Me: Yes, I'm fully remote. So every day.  
Them: All right. Okay. Okay, fair enough. And we're about in. In the country. Are you based.  
Me: I'm in dublin in.  
Them: Okay, cool. So a little bit outside the town. No, that's on. That's. That. Is that just because. Let me see. Where are you currently? What company? Oh, you're in Mechanical Lock or orchard? Or orchard. Do they. Do they just not have an office here, or is it just a preference of yours to be remote?  
Me: Yes. There are fully remote company. I'm pretty happy being remote, but. I realized before the pandemic that I was commuting into central Dublin and then being on video calls all day to people in the east and west coast of the US So then. When the pandemic happened. My work life didn't change very much. It just didn't have to commute anymore. But it is really nice, actually, if you're actually working with people in there, same city, it's really nice to get a little bit of time. With them.  
Them: I suppose I can go into that topic now in just a second, but just to kind of give you an idea what to expect. From this call, David. So generally speaking, what I try to do is go through your profile as quickly as possible for about 10 minutes just to kind of, kind of get an outline of, you know, what it is you do like, or, like, your core skill set, all that kind of stuff. See what it is you want to work. On that kind of thing. And then at the end, basically just try and have, I suppose, more. More questions from your side, you know, just to answer any questions you have, whether it be about the process or the role or anything like that. When we see where we go from there. Does that sound good?  
Me: That sounds good. Yep.  
Them: Cool. So, David, you've already mentioned that you're in hold. Now, look, in terms of how we operate, we are a 50% on site. Company. In terms of, like, for example, the role, like, that you're being considered for at the moment. Like. So the Revenue Experience is one. They do have a sister team here in Dublin. That's our Commerce Systems team. So there are engineers that you'd be interacting with and you'll be partnering alongside in terms of some of your more immediate team. Like, they are a bit spread out between. Like, the org is basically split up into, like, there's some folks in India, there's some folks in the U.S. and then there's some folks in Ireland. So you'd be working across all those groups. Now look, there are staff engineers in in the US And India as well. I think you'd probably be the only staff engineer in this org in Dublin. But basically how that kind of works is like maybe one evening a week you'd kind of work with the US folks, and then the rest of the time you kind of tend to partner a bit more heavily with the, with the India based folks because there's less of a time zone different there.  
Me: Which side of the us are the american folks?  
Them: I think they're west coast, so it would be the, you know. But basically the way it kind of works is we really try to utilize the two hours of overlap time. So between, I think 4 and 6 is when we tend to cram in a lot of the meetings between the Ireland and the US. And that's part of the reason why we don't do as much hiring as we used to in the past in, like, you know, mainland Europe. Like, for. For remote roles and things like that. Like that. Those days are. We've kind of moved on a little bit from that, and now we kind of tend to focus. So, for example, I'm hiring all the staff engineering roles in Europe, apart from Romania, and all the roles, like, of all the locations. So I work across, like, London, Dublin, Barcelona. And I did other kind of location, smaller locations as well. But amongst all of them, it's all the staff engineering roles have been in the HQ Dublin, because it just has that better time zone overlap as well. So that's kind of where we're coming from on that side of things. Like, do you think you'd be okay with the 50% remote or 50% on site, I should say. Or would you see that as an issue?  
Me: No, that would be fine. More of a concern would. Be what the spread is between what my time spread would be between trying to coordinate with both India and the West Coast. That's a pretty widespread.  
Them: Yeah. So what I. Yeah. So it's. It's like basically the way the hiring manager puts it is that data, like, I suppose you dedicate one evening a week. Because here, here's how it works. Like, we hire people that are able to set boundaries. If. If you're a person that can set boundaries for yourself. Like no one's. No one in the US Is going to tell you, oh, it's late there. You should. You should log off. You have to be the person that decides that. So you put time aside one evening a week. You set your boundaries. You say, this is my. This is my week, or this is my day for the US Meetings. Now, we'd still want to expect you to stay on all night or anything like that. It would be a couple of hours extra in the evening just to catch up at your meetings on that west coast. The rest of the time you spend working across the India teams or the India based teams. Because there's only a four or five hour times of difference there. And as I said, there's a sister team in, in Ireland as well, so that's generally how it works.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: A lot of conversations kind of happen between documentation as well, so it doesn't always require, you know, to have regular, you know, meetings every day. That's generally how it works.  
Me: And. Where did the decision makers where are the decision makers based?  
Them: So the hiring manager for this role is based in Dublin. I'm not sure. I'd say his manager is probably based over in the US So there's probably a few decision makers over in the U.S. yeah.  
Me: And on the Indian side.  
Them: I'm not sure. I'd say probably. I'd say it eventually funnels back to the U.S. yeah, because, like, that's generally where the. The top brass is.  
Me: Okay? Right. And what's the sort of group size? How many teams would I be interacting with in the revenue experience?  
Them: So you see, it's more of. Because staff engineers here are not just dedicated to one team, they're dedicated to an org. So you'd be probably working across commerce systems, revenue, experience, I think Snowflake and billing. So it's in within billing. I think you'd be working across three or four different orgs, like three or four different teams. And you're probably looking. I think there's. Off top of my head, I think there's. I think there's about 100 in total. Let me just go into the document for revenue experience. Just refresh my memory on that. Yeah. So there's 55 across three teams, and then there's a sister org that has Commerce Systems that has another 50 engineers. So you'd probably be working across the three teams of 55 engineers, and then you'd be working closely with the sister Orga 50 as well.  
Me: Gotcha. And is the commerce org all in dublin? Or are they 55 spread across those time zones as well?  
Them: I'd say I don't. I'd imagine it's. I don't think it's the same time zones. I think they have a large portion in Ireland, but I don't think all 55 are in Ireland.  
Me: Gotcha. How big is the Irish office these days?  
Them: Well, we just moved into a new office, so we moved into one of LinkedIn's old buildings. I don't. But we're about seven, eight floors. We own the whole building. Or we don't own the whole event, we have the whole building.  
Me: Okay?  
Them: I don't know what the capacity is. I'm not going to lie to you. And I don't know what, Erica. What? Our numbers are in Ireland at the moment. I wouldn't know how many full time employees we have here. Probably about a thousand. Mac, If I was to hazard a guess,  
Me: Okay? Yeah. I visited your old offices just before the pandemic.  
Them: Okay?  
Me: You were four floors. Now you're eight, so twice as big.  
Them: Yeah, exactly. So we've done a good bit of growth and it's only going to get bigger because two thirds for future growth is going to be outside of the us, so it's, it's not a case like this. Dublin is our. Is our joint hq, so we have decision makers here. It's not like you're going back to your question of where the decision makers. Like, it's. It's not. It's not like the US make all the decisions. That's not the way it works. Everyone's expected to contribute to the strategy. You know, the. The goal. So everyone gets kind of equal share there now, I suppose. There happens to be more people with seniority and tenure in the U.S. just that's. That's just the way it tends to go.  
Me: Good to know. You said you wanted to ask me about my background a bit. And I've been quizzing you on org structure. So, yeah, what do you want to ask?  
Them: Yeah, another talker. Tell me a little bit about Mechanical Orchard. Like, you know, what's your. What's your. Like, what's your role there? How many kind of people? What's your scope there?  
Me: So mechanical Orchard is. We're a three year old startup. Predominantly based in San Francisco, but then with folks spread across the US and then a bunch of us in Europe, small, sort of like 10 of the hundred are in Europe. We focus on mainframe modernization. So we are an AI backed or AI powered startup trying to tackle this problem of mainframe modernization. So my workday is very strange in that I am both working with code that was written before I was born. So lots of COBOL and the latest LLM models, trying to get them to make sense of it. So I feel like I've got one foot in the distant past and one foot. In. There in the future. And my role within that. I've been involved in the infrastructure and release engineering. So the company ships an on prem product. And it has a. Well, there's a component of the product that lives on prem. That gets installed close to the mainframe. And then there's a central control plane. So at the moment, it's a very broad role that sort of spans from. A lot of release engineering work, a fair amount of infrastructure setup, a bunch of sort of sre on call kind of things. So real sort of jackable trades. And then.  
Them: Okay. Are you. Are you doing much in the form of development?  
Me: Yes. Its development of a lot of internal tools. Yeah. So sort of like building tools around, automating release processes, doing license scanning. And in the. And the last year, we've been pulling a lot, or at least I've been putting a lot of. Sort of AI driven development. So trying to figure out how do I. How do I augment my. Staff engineer experience. If I now have a whole team of. Increasingly capable AI engineers under me.  
Them: Okay. So do how many people are under your kind of technical guidance?  
Me: The aug is about 15 at the moment. But they're all. They're all very senior.  
Them: Okay?  
Me: So there's not a lot of juniors in our org at the moment.  
Them: Okay, and where do you stack? Like, are you the kind of lead of them, or are you kind of like middle of the bunch?  
Me: I have been one of the three sort of leadership group. For most of my tenure here. I'm now sort of branching out into some of the development teams, trying to help them with releasing their stuff more efficiently.  
Them: Okay? Okay, so one of three in the leadership group. Tell me a little bit about Shopify, because that was your. That. Was that your previous role, or was that your role?  
Me: Yeah. Yeah, yeah, I was at Shopify prior. Yeah. So at Shopify, I joined their data engineering org. They were sort of standing up a data reliability. Function. Basically to try to get their monster data warehouse. Under control and, you know, producing consistent results. That. The time I joined Shopify, they were doing their. They essentially tripled headcount. Around the time that I joined an organization, it was a bit of a firefight. So I think while I was there, my entire management chain, up to. The CTO up to the CEO changed and I ended up in the. They kind of abandoned the data reliability idea and I ended up on their. On their SRE team. So I was doing a lot of. They had a sort of a role called incident manager on call. So essentially. Handling and overseeing all of the. All of the production incidents that happened on the Shopify platform. And then. Yeah, and then prior to that, I was at. I was at pivotal in Waterman manager, manager role, but also related in that was sort of sre focused.  
Them: Okay? If you were to think of the largest project that you, you, that you've led, you were the main go to person. Now. We don't have time to talk about the details of it. I don't need to know any context about it. I need to not just three points. Because all I want to understand is the scope of the project. How long the project took from start to finish, from conception to delivery, how many people you led technically, and how many teams you had to collaborate with on this project.  
Me: So the longest one was about two years I was working to. It was related to getting customers to adopt on on Prem software. And I was coordinating across 40 R&D teams. And then there were two or three directly in. In my group. And that was at pivotal prior to. Shopify.  
Them: Or did you say 40 or indeed teams?  
Me: Yes. 4 0.  
Them: Okay, and how did you have to. How heavily did you have to collaborate with those? Like, was it just a case that it affected them? Or did you actually have to collaborate with them?  
Me: 00. So it was mostly thought leadership across those. And then there was sort of heavy collaboration, you know, with a sort of subset of maybe 10.  
Them: Okay? R and D were affected. And 10 heavily involved. And how many people were were you leading technically on this project?  
Me: Was about 5 or 10.  
Them: 5 to 10 on the project team. Can you remind me again? You said a customer adoption project. For what? Sorry.  
Me: So this was pivotal Cloud foundry. So this was prior to. Shopify where I worked for six years. And essentially they were, they were shipping an on premise product and they needed to get customers to adopt the latest versions of those.  
Them: Okay? When you like. And these projects that you're working on in your current, like, for example, have you got any sizable projects in Mechanical Orchard Orchard that you're leading?  
Me: So. The sizable in terms of width. Or sort of like breadth. So the release engineering is. Is. We seem to have written components in one of all of the frameworks, and then we're trying to get them working on. On all of the clouds. So it's very wide in, in terms of that breadth. But it's not especially deep. They're still very young.  
Them: Okay?  
Me: There was.  
Them: So have you any projects that would have spanned about a year? Since. Since pivotal. I'm. I'm just digging to see if you've kind of like. Okay, so it's all kind of smaller.  
Me: No. And that's. Yeah. And that's. And that's one of the big frustrations I've had. I'm really just looking for a place where I can get some stable goals. And stable leadership so I can get my teeth stuck in and, you know, and that the. The need for the work doesn't evaporate before we get there. Finding that very frustrating at the moment.  
Them: Okay? And you tend to own design and architecture when you're on working on these projects, I assume.  
Me: Yeah. So really, my sort of. I. I guess the thing that I'm sort of. Gravitate towards is is looking for things that should become processes. Figuring out how to standardize them and then figuring out how to automate. That's. That's that standardized thing.  
Them: Okay? How much of your, like, day is coding based or development based?  
Me: At the moment, it's about 50. 50.  
Them: Okay, so you're 50. Rising code.  
Me: Well. Overseeing the agents, writing code, and then 50 in meetings, coordinating with different people.  
Them: On what? Okay, so what? I'm. So, does your role involve you writing much code yourself at all now?  
Me: Yeah. I mean, there are three bits of code that. I'm actively developing. At the moment. You know, some of them are sort of tools for myself. Some of them are tools to improve a release engineering process. And then there's a lot of kind of glue pipeline work.  
Them: Okay? And what would be your. What would be your strongest programming language? What would you be most fluent and quickest with?  
Me: I've come to realize, or I come to believe that in the. In the age of LLMs, it's less the language and it's more the ecosystem. So the three ecosystems that I'm most familiar with are the Python EcoSystem, the Node TypeScript ecosystem, and the Golang ecosystem, Go Lang and Kubernetes.  
Them: Okay? So basically the reason I'm asking these questions is because, like, prior to this interview process, you're going to have to do coding. Interview. Now, it's not leak code. It's not leak code or anything like that. It's literally. I can't stress this enough because I've said it. To engineers in numerous times to keep picking Python, even though it's not their strongest language. Like you're going to be asked to just do a coding challenge. And I'll be honest with you, speed is probably the most important part of it. Fluency with your language. Given that and the fact that it's not very DSA heavy, it's not your leetcode stuff, what language would you choose?  
Me: Probably typescript.  
Them: Okay? What's your main. I think we've stumbled upon one of your main motivations that you're looking for more ownership Looking for it's more sizable projects get your teeth stuck into. Is there anything drawn you destroy in particular?  
Me: You're a big Dublin employer. It seems like you have some decision makers in this time zone. And you've been around long enough that I'm sure you have nice, big, meaty problems that are going to stick around long enough to be solved.  
Them: How much crap have multitasking so.  
Me: Where all are, I think.  
Them: Yeah. Cool. Are you actively interviewing at the moment?  
Me: I'm ramping up. Yes. I. Am not that confident in the future the financial viability of mechanical orchard so.  
Them: Okay? Are you in any other processes at the moment? Okay, so it's just stripe for now. In terms of if that changes, like, just let me know, because our process takes a bit of time. What's your notes period?  
Me: 30 days.  
Them: And you're an Irish citizen, are you at this point? Because I know you sound like.  
Me: I am. Yes. Yeah. Yes, I'm originally South African, but, yes, I naturalized last year.  
Them: You're a. I think. Okay, cool. Congrats. In terms of compensation, what kind of numbers would it need to be to make sense?  
Me: Somewhere in the 250-300K range. Including equity.  
Them: That would be in loan or what we're looking for. Or what we're looking at, I should say. Look, and that's not including any of the kind of more performance based things like the 250, 300 like you look, that would include your base, your stock and equity and your performance bonus, just your standard performance bonus, which is 20% at this level. But, like, if you're, if you're getting, like, a good rating at the end of the year, you could qualify for PEG pg. Then is another performance equity grant on top of your grant. So there's actually a good bit of money to be made outside of your, you know, your total compensation, if that makes sense, because, you know, we, We. We accompany that really just value and pay for performance.  
Me: How liquid is the equity? Because you're still pre ipo, right?  
Them: Extreme. Very. Yeah, it's. It's very liquid. So, John and Patrick, one method is that John Pratchett cost liquidity rounds every year.  
Me: Okay?  
Them: But apart from that, we also have an equity Choice program. So if you want to, like if you wanted, for example, to take your. To take all of your stock out as cash, you can. Or if you leave it there, it's stuck there until such time as John and Patrick make tender offer or we ipo. But as I say, John and Patrick do it annually and have done consistently for the last few years. But I don't know how many years back, but I'm. I'm. I'm only here a bit over a year myself, but I'm. I'm. I'm told, like they only had one recently, and I. I think I've seen two since I came here, and I'm. Here just a year and probably a year and a half now at this point, or just short of a year and a half. And I've already seen two. So I'd be. I'm. I'm. I'm assured that they do it annually. Do you have any other questions, David?  
Me: Just a quick question on the on call load in this position.  
Them: It's, it's a good question. I'm not sure exactly. Yeah, I'd have to get back to you on that. I, I, I, like, I'm not. I, I, yeah, I, I can't, I can't even hazard a guess. Like, I, I could, I'm told, like, that it's not, you know, any more regular than any other company. But, like, you know, that's not really an answer for you either, so I'd have to.  
Me: Okay?  
Them: I'd either have to get back to you on that or just advise you that as you're going through the process, to even ask the interviewers how often they do. On call.  
Me: Cool. Thank you.  
Them: But yeah. Any other questions?  
Me: Just one last question about the revenue experience. Like which. Which core parts of the of the platform does that cover? Revenue experience of what.  
Them: Billing, so they'd be in our billing side of things. So basically, revenue experience, they're largely responsible for how users experience billing at stripe. So there's multiple users in this context.  
Me: Right.  
Them: So you're covering it across a lot of different spaces in stripe. So like the merchants. So like they own dashboards. That's surfaces to help users understand their bills. Deep dive into complex fee structures. But explainability on why users incurred fees. There's a lot of greenfield surfaces there. So plus the data pipelines that power them. And it's an area of stripe. It's an area of stripe that they've kind of under invested in, to be honest, in the past. So, like, this is something that I suppose they need to kind of get on track a bit more.  
Me: Right. Right.  
Them: Then there's the accounts teams. So like working with the largest, most complex merchants handle Ms. Billings. Basically, when we get things wrong for the users and build better tooling. So they're responsible for building better tooling detection.  
Me: Right.  
Them: And ways to fix upstream problems to improve Ms. Billings. And then they supply tooling to help account teams explain fees and users to and to model the impact of renewal pricing on bills as well. And then finally accounting. So the automate parts of the revenue cycle after billing, including, like, revenue recognition and invoicing. So they own a lot of what like of stripe and what they like when it kind of goes wrong. So they work, work collaboratively with like teams, implement new systems to close the gaps under building side of things.  
Me: Okay? So it sounds like the sort of interface between the internal stripe systems and the customer. The customer is consuming them, yeah.  
Them: Yeah. Yeah. And like, because we've done a lot of different acquisitions and made a lot of strategic kind of acquisitions and things like that, like stable coins and multi. Multi account balances and merchants of record, like, the systems need to evolve to support them. So they need to align the technical roadmap. For how the users, like, experience billing and like, make the changes to accommodate the new features.  
Me: Okay? And how they sort of like product managers and are their staff product managers and designers in Dublin as well. Who's the kind of, you know, what's. What's my team of peers, I guess, would be.  
Them: I.  
Me: My. My question.  
Them: So other staff, other, other senior or staff engineers across, like, you know, the revenue experience teams and the sister org team as well, which is Commerce Systems. So that's generally who. Who your peers would be. You'd be working across with EMS as well, like engineering managers from those different orgs as well. Trying to think like there would. You probably would be working with product too. But, like, yeah. That's. To be honest, that's actually all I have for you. Like, that's. That's generally who you'd be speaking with.  
Me: That's fine. That's great. All right. Well, thank you so much, Tom. And again, I apologize for missing our earlier call.  
Them: That's no worries. Look on my side, like. If you're interested in moving forward, David, I think we should.  
Me: Okay?  
Them: Like, basically the next day to the interview process is two interviews, okay? So this round is going to be purely technical. One interview is going to be a system design interview, and the other interview is going to be a programming exercise. Both of them will be an hour each. Okay. Now, I'll send you an email after this call. And the email will contain, like, basically some written tips that I created myself. But also it'll have a document attached that outline the two interviews. But I like to go through this little pitch anyways. Basically, the system design one is going to be your typical. Like, if you've done a system design interview, I'm sure you have. Getting into Shopify. You'll be on with a senior engineer, probably a staff engineer. They'll ask you a generic question. It won't be on team specific. Mainly what they'd want to see is how you ask good questions, break down the problem, suss out what the problem is, what the core of the problem is and what the key is to the solution. Then they want to see you literally writing down functional and non functional requirements as you gather them. Once you get the functionals, you can build out a basic enough design. Kind of have that kind of presented. Then you'll start to go into a more of a free flow conversation covering off topics. On the non functional side, scalability, reliability. Like topics like identity or pondering herd or, you know, data, data aggregation or data sharding, if it's relevant. Those kind of topics that really staff engineers should know. But maybe a senior engineer wouldn't be so confident in discussing. So the more you're driving that conversation, the better. And generally speaking, you want, after an hour, you want to try and have something as close to production grade as possible, if not production grade. On the other side. It's a programming exercise. Now, even though the call is an hour long for the programming exercise, you won't have anywhere near that amount of time to do the actual coding problem. So that's why speed is key. You'll be given one problem, but there'll be multiple parts to the problem. So I don't know which question you're going to be asked. So I can't tell you how many parts you'll have to complete. Some of them you only have to complete one part. Some of them you have to complete all three parts. Okay. So it's. It's a bit of a lottery. You can ask the interviewer maybe when you start, like, look, how much of this do you want me to complete? But you'll only have 35 minutes of the hour to work on the coding problem. The rest of the time is used for, like, you know, just a bit of an intro and maybe setting you up technically, if you decide to use your own ide, for example, if you are going to use your own ide, I would. You have to turn off Cursor or any other kind of AI building things. We don't allow those. And it would be just good to make sure that your system is kind of ready to go in turn, because, like, there'll be some links that you can use in the documentation. I'll send you to make sure that your system is set up and compatible. But basically to give you the problem. They want to see how you break down the problem again, ask good questions. They'll be assessing you on how, what questions you ask. How your ability to write clean, readable and reusable code with your chosen language. Testing your code and debugging your code. So, like, for example, be a bit streetwise about it because you are timed, there's no need for you to go writing a page. Testing suite. That'll just take up too much time. We will give you some test cases. You can use those. It's better to complete. Enough of the problem. And then go back at the end and say, look, in the real world, what I would have done is this, this, and this. I was just trying to optimize for time and just get to the point that you need to get to prioritize that first because, say, for example, you need to complete two parts. And you only complete one and a half. But you complete one and a half perfectly. We still have to say no. That's just the way we that's just the way we do it. So definitely optimize for progress or not optimize bias for progress.  
Me: How. How representative of the way that stripe engineers code. Is that interview? Because I'm very surprised you don't allow. LLM assistant. That seems like asking someone to show you that they can.  
Them: Yeah. Look, we're. We're just.  
Me: Write in pencil in a world where everybody prints on inkjets.  
Them: Yeah, like, it's a fair point. We're not there yet. In terms of introducing LLM into our coding interviews. Like at the same time. I know what you're saying. It's like, you know. It's kind of like if you're interviewing for an English professor job, and it's like, oh, can you spell this for me? And you're like, well, I could just Google it. You know, we still. We still want to see that you can. That you can spell the word, you know, like, we want to see that you can actually do it and that you don't just rely on the tools. It's just where we're at. I know some other companies may have incorporated LLMs into their process, but we're just not there yet.  
Me: Cool.  
Them: But you would be allowed to use, like, those kind of tools when you're actually working here.  
Me: Right. Good.  
Them: But we do. We do want to assess that you're still able to code before we go forward with a hire.  
Me: Cool. That's good to know. Thank you.  
Them: Do you have any questions for me on any of that, David?  
Me: Not anymore. No.  
Them: Cool. Well, look, I'll send you over the details, and there's no link or anything like that. You just reply back to me with a list of dates and times that you're free to do the next round. They don't have to be on the same day, but we will schedule both. Look, we're Thursday. So nothing's going to happen this week. If you could send me on your availability for next week and the following week. Then we can, you know, we can try and get the first round done before Christmas, and we'd probably likely finish off after Christmas.  
Me: That sounds good. All right. I'm actually. I'm away this weekend, so I will get back to you. Early next week.  
Them: Like, even if you could get. Just because I need to try and give our interviewers as much notice as possible. It can be tricky this time of year. So if you can just send me your availability and even if you want to leave the availability to stay from the end of next week, that's fine, but just just, just, just. So we have it in the system and it's ready to go for when you're back from your holidays.  
Me: Okay. Yep, I can do that. Sounds good. All right.  
Them: Excellent.  
Me: Thanks, tom.  
Them: No worries, David. Have a good rest of your day and talk soon.  
Me: Likewise. Cheers.
