- question: What is the root cause of the 1.3/5 TrustPilot consumer rating? Is this
    customer service, policy, product, or cultural?
  why_important: CRITICAL. Massive gap between host ratings (96% 4+ stars) and consumer
    experience (1.3/5). Need to understand if this reflects deeper cultural issues
    that would cause moral injury working there. Could this be review bombing or real
    systemic problems?

    right-sizing or signal of caution. Current growth is 5.7% headcount YoY which
    is modest.
