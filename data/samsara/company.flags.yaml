    - &id001
      flag: Exceptional financial stability with zero layoff risk
      impact: For a 25-year veteran, provides employment security and predictable
        income during uncertain economic times. $702M cash, zero debt, positive FCF,
        and 30% growth eliminate funding risk that causes layoffs at earlier-stage
        companies.
      confidence: High - Q2 FY2026 financials explicitly show $702M cash, zero debt,
        $44-50M quarterly FCF, 15% operating margins
    - &id002
      flag: Genuine remote flexibility with no RTO mandate
      impact: Rare among public tech companies in 2025. Allows geographic freedom,
        eliminates commute, supports family/life priorities. Policy eliminated required
        office days in 2021 and maintained through 2024-2025 when many reversed.
      confidence: High - Explicit October 2021 policy change, no RTO during 2024-2025,
        many roles listed 'Remote - US/Canada'
    - &id003
      flag: Legitimately interesting technical challenges at scale
      impact: 'Provides intellectually stimulating work for experienced engineer:
        edge AI constraints, distributed systems correctness, 6T data points/year,
        real-time processing, modern ML platform (Ray). Meaningful platform-scale
        impact opportunities.'

    strong_positives: &id009
    - &id004
      flag: Modern, well-architected tech stack
      impact: Go, React, TypeScript, GraphQL, Ray ML platform, Kubernetes, Terraform
        represent current best practices. Avoids legacy technical debt that limits
        engineer effectiveness and learning.
      confidence: High - Engineering blog details, job postings confirm stack
    - &id005
      flag: Clear staff+ engineering career ladder
      impact: Well-documented roles and responsibilities for staff/senior staff/principal
        levels. Engineers 'chart their own path', work cross-functionally, have architectural
        influence. Staff role is IC leadership not just senior coding.
      confidence: High - Job descriptions detail staff+ expectations, employees confirm
        reaching staff in 5 years
    - &id006
      flag: Strong product-market fit with low churn
      impact: 115-120% net dollar retention, 94% of large customers use multiple products,
        8x ROI documented by IDC. Product is genuinely valuable to customers, reducing
        risk of business model failure.
      confidence: High - Q2 FY2026 earnings explicitly state 115-120% NDR, 94% multi-product
        adoption
    - &id007
      flag: Mission-driven product with real-world impact
      impact: Safety improvements (drowsiness detection, collision warning), sustainability
        benefits (route optimization, fuel reduction), operational efficiency for
        customers. Work has tangible positive outcomes beyond pure profit.
      confidence: Medium - IDC study shows $2M annual customer savings, safety features
        documented, but impact magnitude varies

      flag: Extraordinary gap between overall and engineer satisfaction (57 percentage
        points)
      impact: Only 17% of software engineers recommend company to peers vs 74% overall.
        This 57-point gap indicates systemic problems specific to engineering organization,
        not company-wide culture. For a staff engineer role, this is the most relevant
        signal.
      confidence: 'High - Glassdoor filtered by role: engineers 3.1/5 with 17% recommend
        vs overall 4.0/5 with 74% recommend. Blind shows 3.6/5 for engineers with
        management at 3.2/5 (lowest category).'
    - &id011
      flag: Consistent reports of unsustainable work-life balance
      impact: Multiple independent 2024-2025 reviews report weekend work expectations,
        'zero work life balance', on-call '1 week a month never leaving phone/computer',
        PTO requests denied despite unlimited policy. Pattern emerged post-2023, suggesting
        permanent cultural shift not temporary crunch.
      confidence: 'High - Review quotes: ''expected to work weekends and long hours
        365 days a year'', ''on-call is absolute worst...paged at 3am'', ''PTO requests
        denied both times I''ve asked'', ''remote work deceptive because Samsara uses
        it to overwork employees''.'
    - &id012
      flag: Sharp cultural deterioration starting 2023-2024
      impact: Multiple reviews describe shift from 'mutual respect to micromanaging',
        'culture was good until 2023', 'culture completely flipped', 'terrible and
        short-sighted upper management'. Timing aligns with post-IPO profitability
        pressure, suggesting permanent change not temporary phase.
      confidence: 'High - April 2025 review: ''Culture disappeared once we went into
        ship ship ship mode''. Another: ''The culture has completely flipped on its
        head...Culture is nonexistent''. Comparisons to ''Amazon 2.0'' for bureaucracy.'

      flag: Management doesn't understand technical complexity
      impact: Reviews cite product management 'doesn't understand technical complexity
        and gets mad when things aren't done in an insane timeline', decisions 'very
        top down', 'low standards in software engineering'. For staff engineer expecting
        autonomy and technical influence, this limits effectiveness.
      confidence: 'High - Multiple reviews 2024-2025. One engineer: ''Building ship
        as it sails, no broader system level considerations''. Another: ''roadmap
        isn''t being used anymore, decisions very reactive''.'
    - &id014
      flag: Slow promotion velocity (3-4 years per level)
      impact: Engineers report spending 3-4 years per level, with some leaving companies
        to advance. For a staff engineer, this means long path to senior staff/principal.
        Reviews mention 'hard to achieve promotion bar'.
      confidence: 'Medium - Multiple Glassdoor reviews cite slow promotions, engineers
        leaving for advancement. One: ''seems like there is a hard to achieve promotion
        bar...engineers spending 3-4 years leading some to switch companies''.'
    - &id015
      flag: Base salary 20-50% below market, offset by equity
      impact: Engineers report 'base compensation much much lower end offset by stocks',
        one took '50% pay cut'. For experienced engineer with family/mortgage, low
        base creates cash flow risk despite total comp targeting top 25%.
      confidence: High - Multiple reviews cite below-market base. Software engineers
        rate compensation 3.3/5, 16.7% worse than company average. One explicit '50%
        pay cut' statement.
    - &id016
      flag: Ongoing benefits reductions
      impact: 'Reviews report ''taking away benefits every quarter'': sabbatical programs
        cut, equity removed for entry-level roles, healthcare benefits for caretaker/medical
        leave rolled back. Indicates cost optimization at employee expense.'
      confidence: 'Medium - Multiple 2024-2025 reviews cite benefits cuts. Specific
        reductions listed: sabbaticals, entry-level equity, healthcare for caretakers.'
    - &id017
      flag: Large number of recent college grads
      impact: Multiple sources note heavy junior presence. For 25-year veteran, could
        mean significant mentorship load, limited senior peer group, or lack of engineering
        maturity/best practices.
      confidence: Medium - Reviews mention 'large number of recent college grads',
        engineers reaching staff in 5 years from college. Interview difficulty rated
        moderate (2.98/5).
    - &id018
      flag: Director stated 'prioritizes work over family' in 1:1
      impact: One review reports director explicitly stating this value in 1:1 conversation.
        Indicates cultural acceptance of work-first mindset at leadership level. Extremely
        concerning for work-life balance priorities.
      confidence: 'Low - Single Glassdoor review 2024-2025: director made statement
        in 1:1 meeting, but aligns with broader work-life balance concerns.'

missing_critical_data:
- question: What is the actual team-specific work-life balance and on-call burden?
  why_important: Reviews show widespread work-life issues but experiences may vary
    by team. On-call expectations, weekend work frequency, and PTO approval rates
    could be significantly better on specific teams. This is make-or-break for a 25-year
    veteran prioritizing sustainability.
  how_to_find: 'Request to speak with 2-3 current staff engineers on the specific
    hiring team (not just manager). Ask directly: ''How often do you work weekends?'',
    ''What''s on-call rotation frequency?'', ''Have you had PTO requests denied?'',
    ''What time do you typically stop working?''. Check team-specific Glassdoor reviews
    if team is mentioned.'
  mountain_element: daily_climb
- question: What is the staff+ engineer turnover rate and departure reasons?
  why_important: High turnover of experienced engineers indicates culture incompatibility,
    limited growth, or work-life issues. Departure reasons reveal whether concerns
    are addressable. Company shows 20.9% overall growth but may be backfilling senior
    departures with juniors.
  how_to_find: Ask hiring manager directly for team's staff+ attrition rate over past
    18 months. Request LinkedIn back-channel with former staff engineers who left
    2024-2025. Check team composition history via LinkedIn to spot departures.
  mountain_element: rope_team_confidence
- question: How does the specific hiring manager approach work-life balance and technical
    decisions?
  why_important: Management quality rated 3.2/5 on Blind with reviews of 'terrible
    and short-sighted upper management', but experiences vary by manager. Direct manager
    has outsized impact on day-to-day experience. Manager's technical depth determines
    whether they understand complexity or 'get mad about timelines'.
  how_to_find: 'Multiple conversations with hiring manager probing: ''Tell me about
    a time your team missed a deadline - how did you handle it?'', ''How do you balance
    speed vs technical quality?'', ''What''s your policy on weekend work?'', ''How
    do you handle engineers who are burned out?''. Ask for skip-level conversation
    with manager''s manager.'
  mountain_element: rope_team_confidence
- question: What is the actual compensation offer structure (base vs equity split)?
  why_important: 'Reviews indicate 20-50% below-market base offset by equity. For
    25-year veteran likely with financial obligations, low base creates cash flow
    risk. Need specific numbers to evaluate: a 30% below-market base may be acceptable,
    50% may not be.'
  how_to_find: Request specific comp breakdown during offer stage. Use Levels.fyi
    to benchmark staff engineer at Samsara (appears to be L5-L6 range). Negotiate
    base salary aggressively given reviews of below-market base.
  mountain_element: daily_climb
- question: What is the team's approach to 'ship ship ship' pressure vs technical
    quality?
  why_important: Reviews cite cultural shift to 'ship ship ship mode' over thoughtful
    engineering. For staff engineer expected to set technical direction, need to know
    if team values architecture, technical debt management, and long-term thinking
    vs pure velocity.
  how_to_find: 'Ask hiring manager: ''How do you balance shipping quickly vs building
    for long term?'', ''Give example of when team said no to feature to pay down tech
    debt'', ''What''s your code review culture?''. Request to review team''s recent
    technical design docs to assess depth.'
  mountain_element: chosen_peak
- question: Is the role genuinely remote or are there hidden office expectations?
  why_important: Policy says remote-flexible, reviews say 'remote work deceptive as
    it enables overwork'. Need to validate that remote doesn't mean 'available 24/7'
    and that there's no informal pressure to be in office for advancement.
  how_to_find: 'Ask current staff engineers: ''Are you remote? How often do you go
    to office? Any pressure to be in office?''. Clarify with manager: ''What percentage
    of team is remote? Any expectation I attend office for key meetings/events? How
    does remote affect promotion?'''
  mountain_element: daily_climb
- question: What percentage of staff engineers successfully promote to senior staff/principal
    and on what timeline?
  why_important: Reviews cite slow promotions (3-4 years per level), hard promotion
    bar, engineers leaving for advancement. For staff engineer, want to understand
    path to senior staff/principal and whether it's achievable or a multi-decade grind.
  how_to_find: 'Ask manager: ''How many staff engineers on your team have promoted
    to senior staff in past 3 years? What does that typically take?'' Request to speak
    with recently promoted senior staff engineer about their path.'
  mountain_element: story_worth_telling
- question: How has the specific team's culture changed from 2023 to 2025?
  why_important: Company-wide reviews show sharp deterioration post-2023, but specific
    teams may have maintained better culture. If hiring team avoided the 'ship ship
    ship' shift and maintains work-life balance, they're an island of green in a sea
    of red flags.
  how_to_find: 'Ask team members with 3+ years tenure: ''How has the team culture
    changed since 2023? What''s better? What''s worse?'' Look for concrete examples,
    not vague positivity. Team that acknowledges company-wide changes but describes
    how they''ve protected their culture is ideal.'
