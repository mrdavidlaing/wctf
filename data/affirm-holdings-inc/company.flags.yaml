  sustainability_confidence: MEDIUM
  overall_assessment: Affirm presents a compelling technical opportunity for ML/AI
    infrastructure work at scale with a mission-aligned product, but significant organizational
    concerns temper enthusiasm. The company has achieved an important financial milestone
    (profitability) and offers exactly the remote-first, modern data infrastructure
    role sought. However, recent layoffs, political culture complaints, and unclear
    technical leadership create meaningful risk. Best suited for senior engineers
    who prioritize technical challenges and can navigate organizational politics.
  key_decision_factors:
  - 'Technical match is excellent: ML at scale, modern data infrastructure (Iceberg,
    Snowflake), production AI systems'
  - 'Financial health improving: first profitable year, but high merchant concentration
    risk remains'
  - 'Cultural fit uncertain: remote-first and compensation are strong, but politics
    and limited growth noted'
  - 'Leadership stability mixed: long-tenured CEO but no CTO, recent layoffs, executive
    transitions'
  - 'Mission alignment strong: building honest financial products without predatory
    fees'
  recommended_next_steps:
  - Deep dive interview questions about technical leadership structure post-CTO departure
  - Probe on internal politics and how it manifests day-to-day for Senior Staff Engineers
  - Understand equity compensation and stock performance since IPO (AFRM stock price
    vs $49 IPO)
  - Talk to current Senior Staff/Distinguished Engineers about career growth reality
    vs framework
  - Assess specific team's culture and manager quality - may vary significantly across
    org
  - Research Amazon partnership stability given Walmart loss - what is retention strategy?
  comparison_questions:
  - How does the ML infrastructure sophistication compare to other options (e.g.,
    Stripe, Databricks, fintech startups)?
  - Is the organizational politics worth tolerating for the technical opportunity?
  - How does total comp (base + equity) compare given stock performance?
  - Is the career growth limitation acceptable given interesting technical work?
  - Does the mission alignment outweigh the merchant concentration risk?
