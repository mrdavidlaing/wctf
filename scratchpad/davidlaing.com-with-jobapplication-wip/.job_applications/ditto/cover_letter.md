Dear Ditto Hiring Team,

I'm excited to apply for the Staff Site Reliability Engineer position in EMEA. The opportunity to work with likeminded engineers on challenging technical problems with mission-critical real-world outcomes perfectly aligns with what drives me as an engineering leader.

## Why I'm Drawn to Ditto

Your edge-native approach to data synchronization resonates deeply with my experience building reliable systems at scale. Having maintained platforms serving $3.5M/minute traffic at Shopify and 100PB data infrastructure, I understand the critical importance of resilient systems when real-world operations depend on them. The fact that airlines like Alaska Airlines and Japan Airlines trust Ditto for their operations speaks to the caliber of engineering challenges you're solving.

What particularly excites me is the opportunity to work alongside engineers who share my commitment to reliability in environments where failure isn't just inconvenient—it's potentially dangerous. Whether it's ensuring U.S. Air Force operations continue seamlessly or keeping airline passengers safe through reliable data sync, these are the kinds of mission-critical challenges that make the work meaningful.

## Relevant Experience for Your Challenges

**Observability at Scale**: At Shopify, I pioneered data reliability practices for 100PB infrastructure while maintaining commerce platform reliability during peak traffic. This experience directly translates to implementing the Datadog, Prometheus, and Grafana observability solutions you need for edge computing environments.

**Distributed Systems Reliability**: My work at Pivotal involved collaborating directly with Google SRE engineers on SLI/SLO design while operating platforms serving millions of users. I established comprehensive incident management processes and 24/7 on-call practices—exactly what's needed for Ditto's global, always-on mesh networking infrastructure.

**Infrastructure Automation**: Currently at Mechanical Orchard, I'm pioneering AI agent orchestration for Kubernetes/Terraform automation. This cutting-edge work in infrastructure automation and self-healing systems aligns well with Ditto's innovative approach to peer-to-peer networking and the automation needs of edge computing environments.

**Global Team Leadership**: Having orchestrated outcomes across 80+ R&D teams in 6 global offices at Pivotal, I understand the collaboration dynamics needed for a globally distributed team like yours.

## Technical Alignment

Your requirements align perfectly with my expertise:
- **8+ years SRE experience**: I bring 15+ years with deep specialization in platform reliability
- **Kubernetes architecture**: Extensive experience across multiple companies, including current infrastructure automation work
- **Monitoring expertise**: Built observability solutions at enterprise scale using your exact tech stack
- **Systems programming**: Proficient in Go and experienced with infrastructure tooling
- **Cloud platforms**: Hands-on experience with AWS and GCP in production environments

## Commitment to Excellence

What sets me apart is my approach to sustainable reliability practices. At every company, I've focused not just on keeping systems running, but on building the processes, tooling, and team cultures that enable long-term operational excellence. Whether it was building SRE teams from scratch at Pivotal or establishing data reliability practices at Shopify, I consistently create environments where reliability becomes a natural outcome of good engineering practices rather than heroic individual efforts.

I'm particularly drawn to Ditto's commitment to diversity and inclusion, and your encouragement to apply even if candidates don't meet every requirement. This speaks to a company culture that values potential and growth—exactly the kind of environment where I thrive.

## Ready to Contribute

I'm excited about the possibility of bringing my experience in large-scale reliability engineering to Ditto's innovative edge computing challenges. The opportunity to work on observability solutions for mesh networking, lead incident response for mission-critical systems, and collaborate with engineers who share my commitment to reliable operations is exactly what I'm looking for in my next role.

I'm based in Dublin and ready to contribute to your EMEA team immediately. I'd welcome the opportunity to discuss how my experience maintaining reliability at scale can contribute to Ditto's mission of redefining how data moves at the edge.

Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards,  
David Laing
