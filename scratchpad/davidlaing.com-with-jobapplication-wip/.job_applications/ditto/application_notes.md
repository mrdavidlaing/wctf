#### **Experience Questions**
**"How many years of SRE/DevOps experience do you have?"**
> 15+ years of Site Reliability Engineering and DevOps experience, including Staff and Senior Staff level roles at Shopify, VMware, and Pivotal. Specialized in large-scale platform reliability, incident management, and observability.

**"Describe your Kubernetes experience"**
> 8+ years of hands-on Kubernetes experience across production environments. Built and maintained K8s clusters at Shopify (commerce platform), Mechanical Orchard (modernization platform), and Pivotal (Cloud Foundry ecosystem). Experience includes cluster architecture, workload management, and automation tooling.

**"Tell us about your monitoring and observability background"**
> Extensive experience with Prometheus, Grafana, and Datadog across multiple companies. At Shopify, pioneered observability for 100PB data infrastructure. At Pivotal, established monitoring practices for platforms serving 1M+ active users. Built LogSearch (ELK-based) handling 2TB daily log ingest at StayUp.io.

#### **Technical Skills Assessment**
**Systems Programming Languages (Go, Rust, C, Java)**
- ✅ **Go**: Proficient - used extensively for infrastructure tooling and automation
- ❓ **Rust**: Limited experience - mention willingness to learn
- ❓ **C**: Some experience - focus on systems understanding
- ❓ **Java**: Limited recent experience - emphasize transferable skills

**Infrastructure as Code (Terraform, Helm)**
- ✅ **Terraform**: Expert - current work involves AI agent orchestration for Terraform automation
- ✅ **Helm**: Proficient - used for Kubernetes application management across multiple roles

**Cloud Providers (AWS, GCP, Azure)**
- ✅ **AWS**: Production experience at Mechanical Orchard and previous roles
- ✅ **GCP**: Extensive experience at Shopify and VMware
- ❓ **Azure**: Limited experience - mention cloud-agnostic approach

#### **Scenario Questions**
**"Describe a time you led incident response for a critical system"**
> At Shopify, I led incident response during Black Friday Cyber Monday (BFCM) when the platform was processing $3.5M/minute in transactions. When data pipeline delays threatened merchant reporting, I coordinated cross-team response, implemented temporary monitoring solutions, and established communication channels with executive leadership. The incident was resolved within SLA, and the post-mortem led to improved data reliability practices across the organization.

**"How do you approach building monitoring and alerting for a new system?"**
> I follow a layered approach starting with SLI/SLO definition based on user experience. First, establish baseline metrics for availability, latency, and error rates. Then build progressive alerting - symptoms before causes, actionable alerts only. I collaborate with product teams to understand business impact and ensure monitoring covers both technical health and business outcomes. Finally, I establish runbooks and ensure the team can respond effectively to alerts.

**"Tell us about your experience with global, distributed teams"**
> At Pivotal, I orchestrated initiatives across 80+ R&D teams in 6 global offices (San Francisco, New York, London, Dublin, Toronto, Boulder). Key lessons: establish clear communication rhythms, document decisions transparently, use asynchronous collaboration tools effectively, and create shared accountability structures. Success requires building trust across time zones and creating systems that work regardless of who's online.

#### **Cultural Fit Questions**
**"Why are you interested in Ditto?"**
> I'm excited about the opportunity to work with likeminded engineers on challenging technical problems with mission-critical real-world outcomes. Ditto's edge-native approach to data synchronization, supporting customers like airlines and military operations, represents exactly the kind of reliability engineering challenge where my experience maintaining systems at scale can make a meaningful impact. The globally distributed team and commitment to innovation in challenging network environments aligns perfectly with my background.

**"What interests you about edge computing and mesh networking?"**
> Coming from large-scale data reliability work at Shopify and platform engineering across multiple companies, I'm fascinated by the challenge of maintaining consistency and reliability in environments where traditional cloud assumptions don't apply. Edge computing requires rethinking fundamental approaches to observability, incident response, and system design - exactly the kind of technical challenges that energize me.
