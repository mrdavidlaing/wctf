**Anthropic Hiring Team**  
Software Engineer, Cloud Inference  
Dublin, Ireland  

Dear Hiring Team,

Working with Claude daily has given me superpowers. This isn't hyperbole – it's the lived experience that drives my application to join Anthropic's Cloud Inference team.

As someone who has built and scaled infrastructure at Shopify ($3.5M/minute peak traffic), pioneered AI agent orchestration at Mechanical Orchard, and led platform SRE teams at Pivotal, I've worked with many AI systems. Claude is fundamentally different. While other models feel like corporate facades or intellectual show-offs eager to prove their cleverness, Claude functions as a genuine digital assistant. "Me plus Claude" genuinely equals more than just me alone – and I want to help bring this transformative experience to millions more users.

My technical background aligns directly with your needs:

**Scaling Distributed Systems:** At Shopify, I maintained platform reliability for 3 million merchants, designing observability systems for 100PB of data infrastructure. I understand the challenges of serving models at massive scale while maintaining sub-second response times and 99.99% availability.

**Python & Cloud Excellence:** From building Python data pipelines at VMware to implementing automation tools for incident response at Shopify, I bring deep expertise in the exact stack you're using. My work spans AWS and GCP, with extensive Kubernetes orchestration experience.

**AI Infrastructure Pioneer:** Currently at Mechanical Orchard, I'm architecting AI agent orchestration platforms where agents collaborate to deploy and manage infrastructure. This hands-on experience with LLM deployment, observability patterns for AI systems, and optimizing compute utilization directly translates to scaling Claude's inference infrastructure.

What truly excites me about this role goes beyond the technical challenges. Former Pivotal colleagues now at Anthropic have confirmed what I suspected: your culture genuinely embodies the high-trust, low-ego environment where I thrive. Your mission resonates deeply with my values – this isn't about making existing millionaires richer or shuffling value between groups. It's about making the pie bigger for everybody.

The opportunity to manage and scale the compute that powers Claude – doing it safely, reliably, and efficiently – is exactly the kind of challenge that would have me excited to get up each morning and help move the ball forward. Being Dublin-based, I'm ready to contribute immediately to your local team while maintaining strong collaboration with global colleagues.

My publication on "SRE & the Vulnerability Budget" and my work establishing data reliability practices demonstrate my commitment to the kind of systematic, safety-first approach that Anthropic champions. I believe in empirical problem-solving, fixing root causes rather than chasing shiny objects, and building systems that serve humanity's long-term benefit.

I want my 80,000 hours of work life directed toward something meaningful – helping to bring Claude to the world in a way that's safe, reliable, and transformative. This is the product and mission I believe in, and I'm ready to contribute my expertise to ensure Claude can scale to serve millions while maintaining the quality that makes it special.

Thank you for considering my application. I'm eager to discuss how my experience scaling critical infrastructure, combined with my genuine passion for Claude and Anthropic's mission, can contribute to your team's success.

With enthusiasm and purpose,

David Laing
