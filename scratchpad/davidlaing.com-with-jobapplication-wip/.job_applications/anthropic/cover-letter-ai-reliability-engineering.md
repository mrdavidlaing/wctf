# Cover Letter: Staff Software Engineer, AI Reliability Engineering

Dear Anthropic Hiring Team,

I'm excited to apply for the Staff Software Engineer, AI Reliability Engineering position in Dublin. Your mission to build AI systems that are safe, beneficial, and understandable resonates deeply with my career-long focus on bringing reliability engineering principles to complex, high-stakes distributed systems.

## Why This Role Excites Me

AI reliability engineering sits at the fascinating intersection of traditional SRE practices and the novel challenges of large language model systems. Having spent the last two years pioneering AI agent orchestration at Mechanical Orchard, I've seen firsthand how traditional reliability frameworks need adaptation for AI systems - from monitoring agent collaboration patterns to establishing SLOs for model performance and self-correction capabilities.

## Relevant Experience Highlights

**Proven SRE Leadership**: At Shopify, I established the Data Reliability Practice for their 100PB data warehouse and maintained platform reliability during $3.5M/minute peak traffic events. This experience taught me how to balance performance optimization with cost management at massive scale - skills directly applicable to AI infrastructure challenges.

**SLI/SLO Framework Expertise**: At Pivotal, I collaborated directly with Google SRE engineers on SLI/SLO design and error budget implementation. I led incident response for critical systems serving millions of users and pioneered chaos engineering practices for resilience testing - experience that translates naturally to ensuring AI system reliability.

**AI Infrastructure Innovation**: Currently at Mechanical Orchard, I'm pioneering AI agent orchestration for Kubernetes/Terraform automation, creating environments where AI agents collaborate and self-correct. This work has given me unique insights into the observability challenges of AI systems and the importance of automated failover in agent-driven workflows.

## What I'd Bring to Anthropic

- **Cross-domain expertise**: I understand both traditional reliability engineering and emerging AI infrastructure challenges, enabling me to design appropriate monitoring systems for availability and latency metrics specific to LLM systems.

- **Incident response leadership**: Experience leading critical incident response across multiple companies, including systems handling millions of concurrent users and petabyte-scale data processing.

- **Cost optimization focus**: Proven track record building systems that balance performance requirements with infrastructure costs - crucial for AI infrastructure where compute costs can scale dramatically.

- **Collaborative approach**: Success working across engineering teams globally, with experience mentoring engineers and establishing practices that scale across organizations.

I'm particularly drawn to Anthropic's commitment to responsible AI development. My background in establishing ethical decision-making frameworks (through Decision Copilot development) aligns well with building reliable AI systems that prioritize safety alongside performance.

The Dublin location is perfect - I'm based here and excited about contributing to Anthropic's European operations while maintaining the 25% in-office collaboration that enables the best team dynamics.

I'd love to discuss how my experience establishing reliability practices for novel distributed systems can help Anthropic define and achieve reliability metrics for your groundbreaking AI products and services.
