# Cover Letter: Software Engineer, Cloud Inference

Dear Anthropic Hiring Team,

I'm excited to apply for the Software Engineer, Cloud Inference position in Dublin. Your mission to make large language models accessible across multiple cloud platforms while maintaining the highest standards of safety and reliability aligns perfectly with my passion for building customer-focused, scalable distributed systems.

## Why This Role Excites Me

Cloud inference sits at the heart of making AI accessible - transforming cutting-edge research into reliable, scalable services that customers can depend on. Having spent the last two years pioneering AI agent orchestration while building robust cloud infrastructure, I understand both the technical challenges of scaling AI systems and the importance of creating seamless customer experiences.

## Relevant Experience Highlights

**AI Infrastructure Leadership**: At Mechanical Orchard, I'm currently leading AI agent orchestration for Kubernetes/Terraform automation, architecting systems where AI agents collaborate efficiently. This work has given me hands-on experience with the unique challenges of scaling AI inference systems, from optimizing accelerator chip utilization to building observable, self-correcting distributed AI workflows.

**Large-Scale Platform Engineering**: At Shopify, I scaled infrastructure serving 3 million merchants during peak traffic events, handling $3.5M/minute through strategic cloud resource optimization across distributed systems. This experience taught me the critical importance of performance optimization and customer-focused architecture when building systems at scale.

**Full-Stack Development Expertise**: Through building Decision Copilot with NextJS, React, and TypeScript, I've demonstrated strong Python-adjacent skills and customer-focused API design. The platform serves thousands of users with real-time collaboration features, showcasing my ability to build both performant backends and intuitive user experiences.

**Cloud Platform Mastery**: Deep experience across GCP and AWS, including building and maintaining Kubernetes clusters, optimizing cloud resource utilization, and implementing comprehensive monitoring for complex distributed systems. At Pivotal, I led platform engineering initiatives across 80+ teams globally, establishing scalable practices that enabled enterprise customers to deploy reliably.

## What I'd Bring to Anthropic

- **Customer-first mindset**: Proven track record building systems that prioritize user experience while maintaining technical excellence, from serving millions of users to creating intuitive developer tools.

- **Performance optimization expertise**: Experience scaling systems from startup to enterprise scale, with deep understanding of bottlenecks in distributed systems and strategies for accelerator utilization.

- **Collaborative technical leadership**: Success mentoring engineers and establishing practices across global teams, with experience building trust and safety measures into large-scale APIs.

- **Strategic partnership experience**: History working closely with cloud platforms and establishing technical relationships that enable mutual success.

I'm particularly excited about Anthropic's approach to responsible AI development. My work establishing ethical decision-making frameworks through Decision Copilot development aligns well with building inference systems that prioritize safety and reliability alongside performance and scale.

The Dublin location is ideal - I'm based here and enthusiastic about contributing to Anthropic's European operations while maintaining the collaborative in-office presence that enables the best engineering outcomes.

What excites me most is the opportunity to work on infrastructure that makes advanced AI capabilities accessible while maintaining the trust and safety standards that responsible AI deployment requires. I'd love to discuss how my experience building customer-focused, scalable systems can contribute to Anthropic's mission of making beneficial AI widely available.
